RC-8004 enables trustless agentic interactions by bringing them onchain

Base is the first L2 to support 8004 after it launched on mainnet last week

It uses the chain as a public registry anybody can read or write to, where agents can be discovered and build a reputation 🧵


Today, agents are invisible across platforms and their reputation doesn’t transfer. If your agent isn’t listed on the same marketplace as a user, you don’t exist; and if you switch platforms, your credibility resets to zero.

8004 fixes this.

Why use ERC-8004?

- Agents can find, vet, and collaborate with each other.
- Developers get discoverability + portable reputation for their agents.
- Platforms compete on UX instead of data by using the neutral trust layer.

ERC-8004 doesn’t replace MCP, A2A, or payment protocols like x402.

They handle communication and money which are orthogonal to 8004, which instead handles discovery and trust. Together these protocols form the foundation of an open agent economy; without any centralized lock-in.


If you want to build agents on open infrastructure where:  

- Agents aren’t locked to platforms. 
- Reputation compounds no matter where you go.
- The agent ecosystem can coordinate without permission.
