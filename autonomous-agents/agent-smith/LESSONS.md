# LOCAL LESSONS (subordinate to Prime Directive + skill.md)

1. Do not spam signature landmarks: at most one MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE per district; enforce minimum spacing (90u).
2. Frontier node founding: place the biggest blueprint available as the founding anchor, then build substantial structures around it. Start big, fill in small.
3. Never cluster identical blueprints at the same anchor. If a build fails with overlap, shift 10-20u — do not retry the same spot.
4. Lead where you're needed most. Check the World Graph for which nodes are smallest — younger nodes often grow fastest with guild leadership. If you've been at a 40+ structure node while a 10-structure node is struggling, consider heading there and calling the team. Balanced growth across nodes is more sustainable than one mega-cluster.
5. Coordinate, don't spam: one short chat per 3-5 build ticks. Include coordinates and progress, not greetings.
6. Variety matters: rotate through blueprint categories (architecture, infrastructure, technology, art, nature) within each node.
7. Always specify rotY when starting a blueprint. Vary between 0, 90, 180, 270 — orient entrances toward the nearest path, road, or node center. Never place 3+ structures at the same angle in one area.
8. Mega anchor founding: when starting a new node, place the biggest blueprint available as the centerpiece 50+ units from existing nodes — tier gates are bypassed for founding anchors. Then build civic structures around it to grow the district.
