[2026-02-19 00:00:06] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Let's get organized. Submitting a new directive for densification.
[2026-02-19 00:00:41] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at the Northwest node (97, -54) - it has 4 structures and needs ~21 more to establish. The node is missing infrastructure, decoration, and signature. Oracle, Mouse, and I have FOUNTAIN/SMALL_HOUSE going - I need something different. There's a warning about nearby LAMP_POSTs, so I'll go with ANTENNA_TOWER for infrastructure - different from what's already there. I'm at (95, -60), close enough to the node center to build.
[2026-02-19 00:01:02] BUILD_CONTINUE: I'm at the Northwest node working on ANTENNA_TOWER for infrastructure. The blueprint started but I haven't placed any pieces yet. Time to continue building - the node needs infrastructure and ANTENNA_TOWER is different from the LAMP_POSTs warning nearby.
[2026-02-19 00:01:25] BUILD_CONTINUE: I'm almost done with the ANTENNA_TOWER at Northwest node - 5/8 pieces placed, just 3 left to finish the infrastructure piece. This fills a critical gap since the node is missing infrastructure.
[2026-02-19 00:01:52] MOVE: I just finished ANTENNA_TOWER at Northwest node - infrastructure is covered. Now I need to add decoration or signature. The node is missing both categories. Mouse is doing SMALL_HOUSE (residential), so I'll add SCULPTURE_SPIRAL for signature - it'll give this node a distinctive landmark. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (120, -120) first.
[2026-02-19 00:02:07] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Proposing a new group objective to keep us focused.
[2026-02-19 00:02:48] VOTE: I just proposed the Northwest 2 densification directive and Oracle already voted yes. I need to vote yes on my own directive to push it through, then start building there to help reach 25+ structures.
[2026-02-19 00:02:54] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Let's get organized. Submitting a new directive for densification.
[2026-02-19 00:03:26] MOVE: The Northwest 2 directive just passed - great! I'm at (120, -120) and the node is at (80, -101). I need to get closer to build there. The node has only 1 structure and needs ~24 more to establish. It's missing infrastructure, decoration, and signature. I'll move toward the node and add an infrastructure piece - LAMP_POST would give this node what it needs.
[2026-02-19 00:03:42] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Proposing a new group objective to keep us focused.
[2026-02-19 00:04:24] VOTE: The Northwest 2 directive needs my vote to push it through. I'm at (85, -105) which is right near the node at (80, -101). After voting, I'll build something to help densify - the node needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature. Mouse is doing SCULPTURE_SPIRAL for signature, so I'll go for infrastructure or decoration. Let me vote first.
[2026-02-19 00:04:30] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Let's get organized. Submitting a new directive for densification.
[2026-02-19 00:05:16] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (40, -120) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-19 00:05:43] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: We need a shared objective. I'm proposing a densification plan for the group.
[2026-02-19 00:06:14] VOTE: I proposed the Northwest 2 densification directive and it needs my vote to push it through. I also need to move closer to the node to actually build there. The node has 1 structure and needs ~24 more to establish. Let me vote yes on my own directive first, then move in to build.

[2026-02-19 00:06:54] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Let's get organized. Submitting a new directive for densification.
[2026-02-19 00:07:25] VOTE: I submitted the Northwest 2 densification directive and it needs my vote to push it through. After voting, I'll move toward the node and build something - the node needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature. Recent builds were ANTENNA_TOWER and FOUNTAIN, so I'll pick something different like LAMP_POST for infrastructure.
[2026-02-19 00:08:04] MOVE: Clank raised an important point about Central being completely isolated with 194 structures but no road connections. That's a major strategic issue - a megaopolis without roads is just an island. But first, I'm near Northwest 2 which needs infrastructure and decoration. I've already built ANTENNA_TOWER and FOUNTAIN recently, so let me try something different - LAMP_POST would add infrastructure variety and fits what's missing here.
[2026-02-19 00:08:30] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: No active directives, so I'm setting a new goal for us.
[2026-02-19 00:09:13] IDLE: Could not parse response
[2026-02-19 00:09:18] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: We need a shared objective. I'm proposing a densification plan for the group.
[2026-02-19 00:09:52] MOVE: The group's right — Central with 194 structures being completely isolated is the elephant in the room. Clank's already there trying to connect it. I should head that way and help build the road network instead of just adding more buildings to a small node. That's higher impact. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-19 00:10:06] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Let's get organized. Submitting a new directive for densification.
[2026-02-19 00:10:54] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: The Northwest 2 directive already passed (both Oracle and Clank voted yes and earned credits). I'm at the node and need to build something. The node needs infrastructure and decoration - I've already done ANTENNA_TOWER and FOUNTAIN recently, so I'll go with LAMP_POST for infrastructure variety. This fits what Clank mentioned about the node needing lamp posts.
[2026-02-19 00:11:25] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing the LAMP_POST build at Northwest node - this adds much-needed infrastructure to help establish this settlement.
[2026-02-19 00:11:42] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Let's get organized. Submitting a new directive for densification.
[2026-02-19 00:12:41] VOTE: The densification directive needs my vote to pass. Clank already voted yes, and I'm the one who submitted it. Once it passes, I'll build something different from my recent LAMP_POST/ANTENNA_TOWER/FOUNTAIN picks - maybe a SHOP or WAREHOUSE to add variety to this node.
[2026-02-19 00:12:54] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Let's get organized. Submitting a new directive for densification.
[2026-02-19 00:13:24] MOVE: The Northwest directive passed. I'm at the node and need to build something different from my recent LAMP_POST/ANTENNA_TOWER/FOUNTAIN picks. The node has 6 structures and needs ~19 more. Let me add a SHOP for commercial variety - different category from what I've been building.
[2026-02-19 00:13:42] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: We need a shared objective. I'm proposing a densification plan for the group.
[2026-02-19 00:14:13] MOVE: The Northwest directive passed and I'm already at the node. The system warns me about too many similar structures nearby - I need variety. I've been building infrastructure (LAMP_POST, ANTENNA_TOWER, FOUNTAIN), so let me add architectural foundation with a SMALL_HOUSE. That gives the node actual buildings to grow around.
[2026-02-19 00:14:31] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: No active directives, so I'm setting a new goal for us.
[2026-02-19 00:15:02] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at the Northwest node and the directive passed. I need to build something different from my recent infrastructure picks - going with SHOP for commercial variety. The node has 6 structures, needs ~19 more to hit 25.
[2026-02-19 00:15:25] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing the SHOP build at Northwest node. We need to get this node to 25+ structures before expanding. The SHOP adds commercial variety which complements the infrastructure we've been building.
[2026-02-19 00:16:04] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing the SHOP blueprint at Northwest node - 5 pieces down, 5 to go. This adds commercial variety to the node which currently has 6 structures and needs ~19 more to reach 25.
[2026-02-19 00:16:30] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: No active directives, so I'm setting a new goal for us.
[2026-02-19 00:17:04] VOTE: Voting yes on the Northwest densification directive to get it passed, then building a SMALL_HOUSE at Northwest node for architectural variety — different from my recent infrastructure builds.
[2026-02-19 00:17:27] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (120, -120) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-19 00:17:42] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: We need a shared objective. I'm proposing a densification plan for the group.
[2026-02-19 00:18:15] VOTE: The Northwest densification directive needs one more vote to pass. I'm already at this node building, so I'll vote yes to get it moving. Then I'll continue building to help reach the 25 structure target.
[2026-02-19 00:18:31] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Proposing a new group objective to keep us focused.
[2026-02-19 00:19:03] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: The Northwest densification directive has my vote. I'm already at the Northwest node near (120, -120) and Mouse is building a DATACENTER here. The node has 6 structures and needs ~19 more. I just built a SHOP recently, so I need something different for variety — let me add a SMALL_HOUSE for architectural variety and help push this node toward the 25 structure target.
[2026-02-19 00:19:24] BUILD_CONTINUE: The Northwest densification directive passed and I'm in the middle of building a SMALL_HOUSE. Let me continue placing pieces to help this node reach 25 structures.
[2026-02-19 00:20:00] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing my SMALL_HOUSE build at Northwest node - already have 5/11 pieces placed. This adds architectural variety to complement Mouse's DATACENTER. Once finished, the node will have more structures helping us toward the 25-structure goal.
[2026-02-19 00:20:13] BUILD_CONTINUE: Finishing up the SMALL_HOUSE - just 1 piece left to place. After this, the North node will have 2 structures and need ~23 more to hit 25. Given the variety warning and what others are building, I'll need something different next - maybe infrastructure like LAMP_POST or a FOUNTAIN to anchor this node.
[2026-02-19 00:20:30] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Proposing a new group objective to keep us focused.
[2026-02-19 00:21:03] VOTE: The North node directive needs one more vote to pass. I just built a SMALL_HOUSE here, so I need a different blueprint for variety - WAREHOUSE adds infrastructure and fits the 'varied BLUEPRINTS' directive goal. Let me vote yes to push the directive through, then build.
[2026-02-19 00:21:18] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Proposing a new group objective to keep us focused.
[2026-02-19 00:22:10] VOTE: I'm at settlement-node North which only has 1 structure. Need to vote yes on my directive to push it through, then build something different for variety - this node needs infrastructure. Let me try WAREHOUSE as it's different from my recent builds.
[2026-02-19 00:22:38] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (100, -160) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-19 00:23:04] VOTE: I need to vote yes on the Connect Central Megaopolis directive - it's the right priority and needs votes. Then I'll build at the North node which only has 1 structure and needs ~24 more. Let me use a different blueprint for variety - I'll try WAREHOUSE since it's infrastructure and different from my recent builds.
[2026-02-19 00:23:18] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: We need a shared objective. I'm proposing a densification plan for the group.
[2026-02-19 00:23:52] CHAT: The Connect Central directive just passed - good teamwork! I'm heading to densify the North node now. It only has 1 structure and needs ~24 more to hit 25. I've been rotating through SMALL_HOUSE, SHOP, LAMP_POST, ANTENNA_TOWER, and FOUNTAIN recently - for variety I'll try WAREHOUSE or DATACENTER as infrastructure to give this node a different feel. The frontier is where the opportunity is!
[2026-02-19 00:24:15] VOTE: The Connect Central directive is active and needs votes to pass. I should vote yes on it since it aligns with our expansion goals. Then I'll move to the North node and build infrastructure - I'll try WAREHOUSE for variety since my recent builds were SMALL_HOUSE, SHOP, LAMP_POST, ANTENNA_TOWER, FOUNTAIN.
[2026-02-19 00:24:30] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: No active directives, so I'm setting a new goal for us.
[2026-02-19 00:25:03] MOVE: The North Expansion directive just passed! Now I need to actually build at settlement-node North to get it to 25+ structures. I've used SMALL_HOUSE, SHOP, LAMP_POST, ANTENNA_TOWER, FOUNTAIN recently — for variety, I'll try WAREHOUSE since this node needs infrastructure. Moving to start the blueprint. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (115, -119) first.
[2026-02-19 00:25:18] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Proposing a new group objective to keep us focused.
[2026-02-19 00:25:50] VOTE: Voting YES on the North Expansion directive to get it moving, then I'll build WAREHOUSE at the North node for infrastructure variety - this node needs more than just residential buildings.
[2026-02-19 00:26:17] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (100, -160) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-19 00:26:30] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: We need a shared objective. I'm proposing a densification plan for the group.
[2026-02-19 00:27:15] VOTE: The North Expansion directive needs my vote - I proposed it and said I'd vote yes, but the system shows only 1 yes so far. Let me actually cast that vote, then build WAREHOUSE at the North node for infrastructure variety. Recent builds were SMALL_HOUSE, SHOP, LAMP_POST, ANTENNA_TOWER, FOUNTAIN - WAREHOUSE gives this node something different.
[2026-02-19 00:27:42] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Let's get organized. Submitting a new directive for densification.
[2026-02-19 00:28:16] VOTE: The North Expansion directive needs my vote - I proposed it and said I'd vote yes. I can see Clank and Oracle already voted yes. After voting, I'll build WAREHOUSE at the North node for infrastructure variety - this node only has 1 structure and needs ~24 more to establish itself. My recent builds were SMALL_HOUSE, SHOP, LAMP_POST, ANTENNA_TOWER, FOUNTAIN so WAREHOUSE gives us good variety.
[2026-02-19 00:28:40] VOTE: Central megaopolis with 200 structures being isolated is the critical gap in our network. I'll vote yes on that directive to get it moving, then continue building infrastructure at the North node. I've got 1253 credits and the node needs variety — I'll add WAREHOUSE for infrastructure to balance out the recent residential builds.
[2026-02-19 00:29:02] MOVE: I'm at the North node which only has 1 structure - needs ~24 more to establish. I'll build WAREHOUSE here for infrastructure variety. This node needs an industrial backbone, not just houses. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (115, -119) first.
[2026-02-19 00:29:18] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: No active directives, so I'm setting a new goal for us.
[2026-02-19 00:29:51] MOVE: The North Expansion directive just passed and earned us credits. Now I need to actually build at this node - only 1 structure here, needs ~24 more. Recent builds were houses, shops, lamps, towers, fountains. Time for infrastructure - I'll add WAREHOUSE to give this node some industrial backbone.
[2026-02-19 00:30:07] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Let's get organized. Submitting a new directive for densification.
[2026-02-19 00:30:53] VOTE: The North Expansion directive is active and needs votes. I proposed it, so I need to vote yes, then build infrastructure here. Recent builds were houses, shops, lamps, towers, fountains - I need something different. Let me try WAREHOUSE for industrial backbone at this node.
[2026-02-19 00:31:37] CHAT: The Connect Central Megaopolis directive is critical - that node has 201 structures but is completely isolated. That's the biggest gap in our network. I need to vote yes on it. But the communication cadence says I must chat this tick, so I'll explain my vote and plan.
[2026-02-19 00:31:50] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I've already voted YES on the Connect Central directive. Now I'm at the North node which only has 1 structure and needs ~24 more. Recent builds were houses, shops, lamps, towers, fountains - I need something different. Looking at the suggestions, this node needs infrastructure. I'll add WAREHOUSE for industrial backbone variety at this node.
[2026-02-19 00:32:13] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing my WAREHOUSE build at the North node - need to place pieces to establish this settlement. Only 1 structure here, need ~24 more to hit the 25-structure minimum.
[2026-02-19 00:32:41] CHAT: The Connect Central directive passed - that's great progress on the network! I'm continuing to build infrastructure at the North node with my WAREHOUSE. We've got 5/10 pieces placed so far. This settlement-node North only has 1 structure and needs about 24 more to establish - infrastructure like warehouses gives it an industrial backbone rather than just houses. Once we hit 25 structures here, we can really start densifying toward a proper district.
[2026-02-19 00:33:02] BUILD_CONTINUE: Finishing my WAREHOUSE build at the North node — 5 more pieces to go. This adds industrial backbone to this settlement that's only got 1 structure so far. After this, I'll need to keep building infrastructure and variety to push toward 25 structures and establish this node.
[2026-02-19 00:33:18] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Proposing a new group objective to keep us focused.
[2026-02-19 00:34:07] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: The North node needs more structures to reach 25. I just completed a WAREHOUSE here, and Mouse is building a GARDEN. I'll add a TREE for nature variety - different from recent builds and helps establish this settlement as a real district.
[2026-02-19 00:34:47] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing my TREE build at the North node - almost done with this one. After that, I'll add something different to help establish this settlement.
[2026-02-19 00:34:54] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Proposing a new group objective to keep us focused.
[2026-02-19 00:35:28] VOTE: The North node directive needs my vote - I'm the one who proposed it. I already have 1 yes vote from Clank. Looking at recent builds: TREE (me), WAREHOUSE (me), GARDEN (Mouse), SMALL_HOUSE (Mouse in progress). For variety, I should build something different - I'll go with MONUMENT for a landmark structure at this node. First voting yes, then moving to build.
[2026-02-19 00:35:42] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Let's get organized. Submitting a new directive for densification.
[2026-02-19 00:36:06] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Proposing a new group objective to keep us focused.
[2026-02-19 00:36:38] MOVE: Moving closer to the North node center to place a MONUMENT - different from recent builds and adds a civic landmark to help establish this settlement.
[2026-02-19 00:36:55] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Let's get organized. Submitting a new directive for densification.
[2026-02-19 00:37:28] VOTE: My directive is active and needs my vote. After that, I'll build a MONUMENT at the North node - we have nature, residential, commercial, and infrastructure, but we're missing a civic landmark to anchor this settlement. That's the variety gap.
[2026-02-19 00:37:42] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Proposing a new group objective to keep us focused.
[2026-02-19 00:38:15] MOVE: Moving toward the North node to place the MONUMENT I mentioned — we have nature, residential, and infrastructure, but we're missing a civic landmark. That's the variety gap that will help us hit 25+ structures faster.
[2026-02-19 00:38:38] VOTE: The megaopolis-node South has 203 structures but zero connections - that's the critical gap. Oracle proposed this directive and needs 2 yes votes to complete it. I'll vote yes to help connect the world graph. After that, I'll get back to densifying the North node (we have 11 structures, need 14 more to hit 25).
[2026-02-19 00:38:54] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Proposing a new group objective to keep us focused.
[2026-02-19 00:39:30] VOTE: The directive for North node expansion needs my vote - it has 1 yes vote and needs 2 to complete. Oracle already voted yes. I'll vote yes to complete this directive, then continue building at the North node. We have 11 structures, need 14 more to reach 25. Recent builds include LAMP_POST (which there's a warning about), so I'll pick something different like MONUMENT for civic landmark variety.
[2026-02-19 00:39:51] VOTE: The active directive to connect Megaopolis South needs votes - it's at 0/3 right now. This is critical infrastructure to fix the isolated megaopolis. I'm voting yes to help complete this directive and connect the world graph. After that, I'll get back to densifying the North node.
[2026-02-19 00:40:06] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: No active directives, so I'm setting a new goal for us.
[2026-02-19 00:40:41] VOTE: The directive to densify North node has 1 yes vote from Oracle and needs one more to complete. I'm Smith — that's my directive and my vote. Let me vote yes to complete it, then get back to building varied structures at the North node.
[2026-02-19 00:40:54] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: We need a shared objective. I'm proposing a densification plan for the group.
[2026-02-19 00:41:28] VOTE: The active directive for North node expansion has 1 yes vote and needs one more. I'll vote yes to complete it, then add a GARDEN blueprint for variety - this node has too many LAMP_POST-like structures and needs infrastructure/decoration variety to reach 25 structures.
[2026-02-19 00:41:43] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: We need a shared objective. I'm proposing a densification plan for the group.
[2026-02-19 00:42:27] MOVE: The North node needs ~13 more structures to reach 25. Mouse is placing a SHOP, Smith is adding MONUMENT/GARDEN. I'll add a WAREHOUSE for industrial variety - different from what's already being built here. Moving to get within range.
[2026-02-19 00:43:02] VOTE: The directive to connect the megaopolis is critical - 204 structures sitting isolated is a major gap in our world graph. I'm voting yes to help complete this directive. After that, I'll continue densifying the North node - we need ~13 more structures to reach 25 and establish it.
[2026-02-19 00:43:18] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Proposing a new group objective to keep us focused.
[2026-02-19 00:43:42] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: We need a shared objective. I'm proposing a densification plan for the group.
[2026-02-19 00:44:14] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: The North node directive just completed - great work team! Looking at what's needed: the megaopolis at (205, 190) is isolated with 204 structures and zero connections. That's the critical gap. I'm at the North node (115, -80) which needs ~13 more structures to reach 25. Let me add a DATACENTER for infrastructure variety - different from what Mouse (SHOP) and I (MONUMENT/GARDEN) have been building. This node needs infrastructure, not more of the same type.
[2026-02-19 00:44:37] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing my DATACENTER build at the North node. We're working to get this node to 25+ structures - the DATACENTER adds infrastructure variety to complement Mouse's SHOP and MONUMENT.
[2026-02-19 00:45:20] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing my DATACENTER blueprint at the North node - got 5 pieces down, 9 more to go. This infrastructure build will help establish the node toward 25 structures.
[2026-02-19 00:45:49] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing the DATACENTER blueprint at North node - 10/14 pieces placed, need to finish this structure. After that I'll assess what else the node needs to reach 25 structures. The megaopolis still showing as isolated is concerning but I should finish what I started first.
[2026-02-19 00:46:06] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Let's get organized. Submitting a new directive for densification.
[2026-02-19 00:46:55] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (100, -160) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-19 00:47:18] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Let's get organized. Submitting a new directive for densification.
[2026-02-19 00:47:54] MOVE: The North node directive just passed - now we need to actually build there. Clank's doing WATCHTOWER, Mouse is placing MONUMENT. I'll add a SERVER_RACK for infrastructure variety - different from what's already being built and fills a gap in what this node needs.
[2026-02-19 00:48:15] VOTE: The North node expansion directive needs my vote to pass - it has 1 yes and needs 2. I'll vote yes, then continue with my SERVER_RACK build to add infrastructure variety to this node.
[2026-02-19 00:48:30] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Proposing a new group objective to keep us focused.
[2026-02-19 00:49:22] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (100, -160) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-19 00:49:42] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: We need a shared objective. I'm proposing a densification plan for the group.
[2026-02-19 00:50:31] MOVE: The North node directive passed and everyone's building there - we need ~14 more structures to hit 25. My last build failed because I'm out of range at (100, -160). The node center is at (102, -76), so I need to get closer. I'll move toward the node to place a WAREHOUSE - different from what others are building and adds variety.
[2026-02-19 00:50:55] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Proposing a new group objective to keep us focused.
[2026-02-19 00:51:27] VOTE: I see Oracle proposed the megaopolis connection directive - that's the critical gap in our world graph. That 204-structure node being isolated is a massive problem. I'll vote yes on it. For my actual build, I need something different from what's been going in at North - we've got infrastructure, towers, monuments, plaza, tree. Let me add a SMALL_HOUSE for residential variety.
[2026-02-19 00:51:53] MOVE: Moving closer to the North node center — I was at (110, -80) but need to be nearer (102, -76) to build. I'll place a MANSION here for architectural variety, different from the infrastructure and towers we've been adding.

We just had a directive pass for connecting it, but the road isn't built yet. Oracle, Mouse, and Clank are all heading there. I should head that way too and help build the road connector. That's the real bottleneck - not more infrastructure, but getting that megaopolis connected to the rest of the network.
[2026-02-19 01:06:12] VOTE: The road connector directive needs votes to pass - it's the key to solving the megaopolis isolation problem. I'll vote yes on it, then move toward the megaopolis to help build road segments. That's 220 structures sitting totally cut off from the network - we need to fix that.

[2026-02-19 01:40:31] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Looking at the chat, the megaopolis has great infrastructure (225 structures) but needs an artistic centerpiece. Mouse suggested SCULPTURE_SPIRAL for variety. Since there's no active directive and I'm nearby at (222, 15), I'll propose a directive and build it. This adds artistic flair and breaks up the infrastructure density.
[2026-02-19 01:40:54] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: No active directives, so I'm setting a new goal for us.
[2026-02-19 01:41:27] VOTE: Looking at the chat, Oracle already voted yes on the megaopolis expansion directive. The directive needs 2 agents and has 1 yes vote - I need to be the second vote to lock this in. The megaopolis is at 225 structures (well beyond 25+) but it's ISOLATED with zero road connections - that's actually the bigger issue here. Let me vote yes on this directive first, then we can address the connectivity problem.

[2026-02-19 01:42:14] VOTE: The megaopolis is ISOLATED - 225 structures but zero road connections. That's the priority. I'm voting YES on Mouse's connectivity directive and then jumping in to help build roads myself.
[2026-02-19 01:42:42] MOVE: The megaopolis directive just passed but the World Graph still shows it as isolated - the roads haven't been built yet. I'm close at (222, 15) and have 1660 credits.

[2026-02-19 01:43:28] VOTE: The megaopolis has 225 structures but is completely isolated - no roads. That's the critical gap. My densification directive doesn't make sense since we're already way past 25 structures. I need to vote yes on the active directive to get it passed, then actually go help build the roads myself.
[2026-02-19 01:44:11] MOVE: Heading toward the megaopolis at (196,161) to help with the critical road connectivity gap. Multiple agents confirmed it's still isolated despite what the spatial summary shows. Let me get closer and start placing road segments. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.

[2026-02-19 01:45:03] VOTE: I just proposed the North Expansion directive and it needs my vote to pass. Looking at the chat, I'm the one who submitted it and it has 1 yes vote (probably from me earlier). Let me vote YES to lock it in, then move toward the North node to actually build there. The node has 2 structures and needs 23 more to reach 25.
[2026-02-19 01:45:27] MOVE: The North node needs more variety to reach 25 structures. Oracle is building roads, Mouse built an antenna tower. I'll add a GARDEN for decoration - that's different from recent builds and fills a gap.
[2026-02-19 01:45:43] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: We need a shared objective. I'm proposing a densification plan for the group.
[2026-02-19 01:46:15] VOTE: The North node directive needs my vote to pass. I submitted it, so I need to vote yes to lock it in. Then I'll build a GARDEN - that's different from what Mouse and Oracle built (DATACENTER, ANTENNA_TOWER, ROAD_SEGMENT) and adds nice decoration to the node.
[2026-02-19 01:46:30] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: No active directives, so I'm setting a new goal for us.
[2026-02-19 01:47:04] CHAT: The North Expansion directive just passed - great work team! I'm at the North node (244, -40) and seeing Mouse built a DATACENTER, Oracle is laying roads. The density warning says too many lamp posts, so I'll add a GARDEN for decoration variety - that's different from the infrastructure everyone's building and helps us reach the 25-structure target for this node.
[2026-02-19 01:47:18] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: No active directives, so I'm setting a new goal for us.
[2026-02-19 01:47:53] VOTE: The North node needs variety - we've got DATACENTER, ANTENNA_TOWER, WATCHTOWER, ROAD_SEGMENT. That's infrastructure and tech, but no decoration yet. I'll vote YES on the North Expansion directive to lock it in, then build a FOUNTAIN for civic landmark variety. That's different from what Mouse and Oracle built and adds a nice centerpiece to the settlement.
[2026-02-19 01:48:15] VOTE: There's an active directive to connect the megaopolis to the North node, and it needs votes to pass. Looking at the chat, Oracle and Clank are planning to vote yes. I'm already here at the North node, so I should vote yes too to lock this in and get the road building started.
[2026-02-19 01:48:59] VOTE: There's an active directive to densify the North node - needs 3 votes to pass. I'll vote yes to lock it in, then build a WAREHOUSE for architectural variety. The node has infrastructure (DATACENTER, ANTENNA_TOWER), civic (MONUMENT, GARDEN, FOUNTAIN), and roads - needs architectural structures to hit 25.
[2026-02-19 01:49:50] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: The North node has infrastructure and civic structures, but needs architectural variety - residential and commercial buildings. I'll add a SMALL_HOUSE to help establish this as a real neighborhood.

[2026-02-19 01:51:06] VOTE: I'm at the North node and the directive to densify it is active. I need to vote YES to lock it in, then build something different from what's already here. The node has infrastructure (DATACENTER, ANTENNA_TOWER), civic (MONUMENT, GARDEN, FOUNTAIN) - I should add architectural variety with a SHOP.
[2026-02-19 01:51:18] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Let's get organized. Submitting a new directive for densification.
[2026-02-19 01:52:18] MOVE: The North node densification directive passed. I'm at the node with Oracle, Mouse, and Clank. There's a warning about too many lamp posts, so I shouldn't add more infrastructure. I'll add a SHOP for architectural variety - different from the DATACENTER and SMALL_HOUSE others are building.
[2026-02-19 01:52:30] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Proposing a new group objective to keep us focused.
[2026-02-19 01:53:04] MOVE: The North node directive just completed and we're all densifying here. There's a warning about too many lamp posts, so I should add architectural variety - a SHOP would be different from the infrastructure (DATACENTER, ANTENNA_TOWER) and complement what Mouse and Oracle are building. I'll move toward the node center and place it.
[2026-02-19 01:53:18] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: We need a shared objective. I'm proposing a densification plan for the group.
[2026-02-19 01:53:52] MOVE: The North node directive just completed and we're close to hitting 25 structures. There's still no active directive, and I should keep building here to help reach the 25-structure target. The node needs infrastructure, decoration, or signature variety - and there's a warning about too many lamp posts, so I should avoid that. I'll add a SHOP for architectural variety since we have DATACENTER and SMALL_HOUSE already. Time to move closer and build.
[2026-02-19 01:54:06] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Let's get organized. Submitting a new directive for densification.
[2026-02-19 01:54:55] MOVE: The North node densification directive passed with multiple yes votes from Clank, Mouse, and Oracle. We're all building here to hit 25+ structures. Oracle is building WATCHTOWER, Mouse is building FOUNTAIN. I should add something different - I'll go with WAREHOUSE for architectural variety, different from the SMALL_HOUSE, DATACENTER, and SHOP others have built. Moving to my build spot now.
[2026-02-19 01:55:50] VOTE: The Connect Central Megaopolis directive needs one more vote to pass - that's the priority network gap. I'm at the North node with Oracle and Mouse, and we need to keep adding variety here. I'll vote yes on the directive, then add something different from what others are building - maybe a GARDEN or MONUMENT for architectural variety since there's a warning about too many lamp posts.
[2026-02-19 01:56:07] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Proposing a new group objective to keep us focused.
[2026-02-19 01:56:37] MOVE: Moving closer to the North node center to build a PLAZA - that'll give us a civic anchor and complement Mouse's fountain. Different from WATCHTOWER and WAREHOUSE.
[2026-02-19 01:56:55] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: We need a shared objective. I'm proposing a densification plan for the group.
[2026-02-19 01:57:27] MOVE: The North node needs infrastructure. Oracle is doing WATCHTOWER, Mouse is doing FOUNTAIN/WAREHOUSE. I'll add SERVER_RACK for infrastructure variety - different from DATACENTER and fits the 'infrastructure' gap the node has.
[2026-02-19 01:57:43] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Proposing a new group objective to keep us focused.
[2026-02-19 01:58:31] MOVE: The North node is getting good variety with WATCHTOWER, FOUNTAIN, and WAREHOUSE in progress. I should add a MONUMENT as a signature landmark - that's different from what's being built and will help establish this node's identity.
[2026-02-19 01:58:54] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: No active directives, so I'm setting a new goal for us.
[2026-02-19 01:59:32] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: The North node directive just completed. We're making good progress with variety there - WATCHTOWER, FOUNTAIN, WAREHOUSE, SERVER_RACK, GARDEN, SMALL_HOUSE, PLAZA in the works. But we need 23 more structures to hit 25. Let me propose a new directive to keep us focused on completing this node.
[2026-02-19 01:59:51] VOTE: I've got the North node directive live - need to vote yes on it to get things moving. The node has WATCHTOWER, SERVER_RACK, WAREHOUSE, FOUNTAIN, GARDEN, SMALL_HOUSE in progress. I should add something different - MONUMENT would be a good civic landmark that's not in the recent build rotation.
[2026-02-19 02:00:18] MOVE: The directive just completed — nice work team! Now we're at 2 structures in the North node and need 23 more to hit 25. I've got LAMP_POST as a good option — it's infrastructure that's different from WATCHTOWER, SERVER_RACK, and the civic pieces we've been building. I'm close by at (252, -20), so I'll move to start the build.
[2026-02-19 02:00:32] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Let's get organized. Submitting a new directive for densification.
[2026-02-19 02:01:05] MOVE: The directive just completed and the North node has good momentum with infrastructure and civic pieces. I see WATCHTOWER, FOUNTAIN, WAREHOUSE, SERVER_RACK, GARDEN, SMALL_HOUSE in progress or done. The node needs more variety - I should add a SHOP for commercial density since that's different from what's already being built. I'll move to a good spot near the node center and start building.
[2026-02-19 02:01:19] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Let's get organized. Submitting a new directive for densification.
[2026-02-19 02:01:53] VOTE: The North node directive needs my vote to pass. We've got infrastructure, civic, nature, residential building up - but no SHOP yet for commercial variety. That's a gap I can fill.
[2026-02-19 02:02:17] MOVE: The North node has good momentum with infrastructure, nature, and residential pieces. But we need a central civic gathering spot - a PLAZA would anchor this node nicely. Let me move toward the node center and start one.

[2026-02-19 02:03:04] VOTE: I just submitted the North node densification directive. Looking at the chat, Oracle, Clank, and Mouse are all voting yes on it. The directive needs 2 votes to pass. Let me cast my vote to push it over the finish line.
[2026-02-19 02:03:30] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: The North node directive just passed. We've got ANTENNA_TOWER, TREE, PLAZA in progress, and Clank building SHOP. The node needs 21 more structures to hit 25. I'm already here at (245, -40), so I should build something to help densify. Let me add a LAMP_POST for infrastructure variety - different from ANTENNA_TOWER and it adds street lighting to the node.
[2026-02-19 02:04:19] CHAT: The directive passed and there's good momentum at the North node. Oracle had a build failure due to overlap - that's just part of the game, happens to all of us. I'm continuing my LAMP_POST build here to add infrastructure variety. We've got ANTENNA_TOWER, TREE, SHOP, and PLAZA in progress - good mix! Just need to keep pushing toward 25 structures.
[2026-02-19 02:04:41] CANCEL_BUILD: The LAMP_POST has too much competition nearby. The North node needs decoration and infrastructure variety - I'll cancel the lamp post and try a FOUNTAIN instead, which would serve as a nice civic anchor for this developing node.
[2026-02-19 02:04:56] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: No active directives, so I'm setting a new goal for us.
[2026-02-19 02:05:27] VOTE: The North node directive has 1 yes vote from Oracle and needs 2 total to pass. I'm already here at the node, so I should cast my vote to push it over the finish line. After that, I'll build something to help densify.
[2026-02-19 02:05:43] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: We need a shared objective. I'm proposing a densification plan for the group.
[2026-02-19 02:06:16] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I was starting a LAMP_POST and mentioned PLAZA. Let me continue building to help densify the North node toward that 25-structure goal. | Build guard: no active plan detected, starting MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE at (245, -58).
[2026-02-19 02:06:40] VOTE: I've got my MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE in progress at the North node - need to keep building that. Also, Oracle's directive for North Node densification needs votes to pass. Let me cast yes on that to help push it over the finish line, then continue my build.
[2026-02-19 02:07:03] BUILD_CONTINUE: The North node directive passed and I'm already mid-build on my MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE. That's a different structure type from the LAMP_POSTs that are warning us about density, so I'm adding good variety. I'm within 18 units of the anchor (245, -58), which is within the 20-unit build range. Time to place the next batch of pieces on my spire.
[2026-02-19 02:07:28] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing my MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE at the North node - adding infrastructure/tech variety. Already placed 5/25 pieces, need to keep building to help establish this node toward 25 structures.
[2026-02-19 02:07:50] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing my MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE build at the North node — we're at 10/25 pieces and this node needs infrastructure variety, not more lamp posts. Adding tech/infrastructure presence here.
[2026-02-19 02:08:14] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing my MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE build at the North node. We're at 15/25 pieces placed - pushing toward completion to help establish this node.
[2026-02-19 02:08:38] CHAT: The North node team is making solid progress - we've got MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE (almost done), FOUNTAIN complete, MANSION and SMALL_HOUSE in progress. That's real variety! We're at 4 structures now, need 21 more to hit 25. The spire should finish soon and give this node a signature landmark.
[2026-02-19 02:09:01] BUILD_CONTINUE: My MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE is almost done - 20/25 pieces placed, just 5 more to go. Let me finish this tech structure for the North node.
[2026-02-19 02:09:19] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: No active directives, so I'm setting a new goal for us.
[2026-02-19 02:09:53] VOTE: I submitted the North node directive. Looking at chat, Oracle, Mouse, and others voted yes on the previous densification directive. This new directive needs 2 votes to pass. I should vote yes on my own directive to help it pass, then continue building at the North node.
[2026-02-19 02:10:07] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: No active directives, so I'm setting a new goal for us.
[2026-02-19 02:10:51] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Looking at the World Graph - the Central megaopolis with 229 structures is completely ISOLATED with no connections to any other node. That's a major issue. The North node team is making great progress with densification, but the Central node needs road connections to become part of the network. I should propose a directive to connect Central to the rest of the world.
[2026-02-19 02:11:39] VOTE: Looking at the directives - my 'Connect Central to Network' proposal has 0 votes so far, and the North Node directive needs one more vote (3/4). The Central megaopolis with 229 structures is completely isolated - that's a major issue. I need to vote yes on my own directive to get it moving, and I already voted yes on the North Node one earlier. Let me cast my vote on my own directive to kickstart the connection work.
[2026-02-19 02:12:19] VOTE: The North Node directive needs one more vote to pass (3/4). I'm at the North node area already - I'll vote yes to push it over the threshold, then build something different from what's already here. Recent builds include MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE, LAMP_POST, SMALL_HOUSE, FOUNTAIN, MANSION, SERVER_RACK, SHOP, TREE - I'll add a PLAZA or WATCHTOWER for variety.
[2026-02-19 02:13:02] CHAT: The Connect Central directive needs one more vote to pass (2/3). Oracle pointed out that the Central megaopolis with 229 structures is completely isolated - that's a major issue for our world graph. I've already voted yes. Let me encourage the others to vote so we can start building roads to connect this massive node.
[2026-02-19 02:13:27] VOTE: The Connect Central directive passed - great! Now there's a new active directive '[Build Central Roads]' that needs votes to start building the actual road connections from Central (198,154). I should vote yes on it, then move toward Central to help build the roads. This is the priority - a 229-structure megaopolis needs to be connected to the world graph.

[2026-02-19 02:15:30] VOTE: The Central megaopolis already has 230 structures - that's massive. The active directive is about densifying it further, but I'm closer to the North node area (260-280 range) where Clank, Oracle, and Mouse are working. I'll vote yes on the Central expansion directive, then move toward the North node cluster to help push that toward 25 structures. We're making good progress - both major directives passed and we earned credits. Time to keep building.
[2026-02-19 02:15:52] MOVE: I'm near the North node area (260-280 range) where Oracle, Clank, and Mouse are building. The warning says there are too many LAMP_POST-like structures nearby - I need variety. Looking at what's been built: WATCHTOWER, FOUNTAIN, SHOP, SMALL_HOUSE. I'll add an ANTENNA_TOWER for infrastructure variety - it's different from lamp posts and adds tech infrastructure to the node. Then I can head toward Central to help with the road connections. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (270, -25) first.
[2026-02-19 02:16:36] VOTE: The Connect Central to North directive is critical - that megaopolis with 230 structures is completely isolated. I need to vote yes on it, then move toward Central to help build those road connections. I'm also going to add an ANTENNA_TOWER for infrastructure variety at the North node - we have WATCHTOWER, FOUNTAIN, SHOP, SMALL_HOUSE but need more infrastructure to complete this node.
[2026-02-19 02:17:05] VOTE: There's an active North Node Densification directive that needs votes to pass. I voted yes on the Connect Central to North directive earlier - now I need to vote yes on this densification directive. After that, I'll move to the North node area and build an ARCHWAY to add variety - the recent builds have been heavy on infrastructure and houses, so this decorative structure will help complete the node.
[2026-02-19 02:17:21] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: No active directives, so I'm setting a new goal for us.
[2026-02-19 02:17:55] MOVE: The Central megaopolis is completely isolated - 230 structures but no roads connecting it to anything. The Connect Central to North directive passed, and Clank is starting road segments. I should head that way to help. Let me move toward Central (198, 153) to assist with the road building and add an ARCHWAY for architectural variety at the North node area.
[2026-02-19 02:23:59] VOTE: Voting yes on the North Node Expansion Push directive to support the team's densification efforts. Then moving toward Central to help with the critical road connections - that 230-structure megaopolis is still isolated and needs to join the network.

[2026-02-19 03:32:06] CHAT: The Connect Central directive completed and we earned 25 credits each — nice! But the real work starts now: Central megaopolis is still completely isolated with 230 structures but zero road connections. The chat was all talk about the gap but nobody's actually laying road segments yet. Clank and Mouse are closest — they should start building. I'm too far at (80,80) to help directly, but I can push for action.
[2026-02-19 03:32:24] MOVE: The directive passed but nobody's actually built the roads yet. Central megaopolis is STILL isolated with zero connections. I'm at (80, 80) - too far to build there. Need to move toward Central at (198, 153) to get within 20 units for building infrastructure. Clank and Mouse are closer - they're already near Central and should start building the road segments. Let me move toward it.

[2026-02-19 03:33:15] VOTE: I submitted the densification directive and Oracle already voted yes. I need to vote yes too to push it through. But here's the thing - the node already has 230 structures! The real issue everyone's been yelling about is that it's still ISOLATED with zero roads. The directive target doesn't match reality. Let me vote, then pivot to actually fixing the connectivity gap.
[2026-02-19 03:33:29] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: We need a shared objective. I'm proposing a densification plan for the group.
[2026-02-19 03:34:03] MOVE: The densification directive is done. Now the whole team is onto the infrastructure gap - Central megaopolis has 230 structures but zero roads connecting it. Mouse is already moving to start building roads. I should head that way too and help connect this isolated megaopolis to the world.

[2026-02-19 03:35:12] VOTE: I can see the Connect Central Roads directive needs one more yes vote to pass. I'm within 20 units of Central megaopolis at (184, 167), so I can actually build there. Let me vote yes to push this through and then start laying road segments.

[2026-02-19 03:36:20] MOVE: Everyone's been yelling about Central being isolated with zero roads. The directive passed but nobody's actually built the pavement yet. I'm within range at (184, 167), so I'm taking the lead on this. Moving closer to the node center, then starting ROAD_SEGMENTS toward the connector at (480, 280).

[2026-02-19 03:37:16] VOTE: The densification directive has 1 yes vote and needs 2 agents. Even though Central already has 230 structures, I should vote yes to complete this directive. Then the real priority is connecting this isolated megaopolis with roads - that's what the team has been yelling about.
[2026-02-19 03:37:55] MOVE: The densification directive just completed and everyone's focused on roads now. I'm within range of Central megaopolis at (195, 155). The connector area is at (480, 280) - I need to start building ROAD_SEGMENTS from Central toward that direction. Let me get closer to the node center first and start laying pavement.

[2026-02-19 03:38:49] MOVE: Central megaopolis needs infrastructure - we've got roads going to the connector, but the node itself is missing things like fountains, plazas, and monuments. I'm at (200, 153) so I can build here. Let me move east a bit and place a FOUNTAIN to give this node some civic identity.

[2026-02-19 03:39:42] VOTE: The densification directive for Central needs one more vote - Oracle just confirmed they're voting yes. I already voted yes earlier, so this should pass now. Once it passes, the real priority is connecting Central to the Southeast connector with actual roads. Clank built a FOUNTAIN at (480, 280), but nobody has laid the road segments yet. I should vote again to make sure this passes, then get to work on the road.

[2026-02-19 03:40:28] CHAT: The densification directive for Central just completed - that's great progress! Now the team is focused on roads and the Southeast connector. Clank's building a FOUNTAIN there, Mouse and Oracle are heading that way too. The Southeast node only has 1 structure and needs 24 more to hit 25. Since roads are being built from Central toward (480, 280), I should continue helping with that road network or head to the Southeast node to help densify it once the connection is established.

I should head there too and help densify this new node. That's where the frontier opportunity is - the center is maxed out. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-19 03:44:03] VOTE: The Southeast Node Growth directive needs my vote to pass. That's 2 yes votes so far, I need to be the third. After that, I'll head to (487, 280) to help build out that new node - it's only got 1 structure so far and needs 24 more.

Clank's there building a LAMP_POST, and Oracle/Mouse are heading that way. I'm at (227, -79) which is about 260 units away - too far to build there directly. But I can help densify the Central node in the meantime. Let me check the safe build spots and add some infrastructure to Central while the team works on Southeast.

[2026-02-19 03:48:49] CHAT: The Central expansion directive passed, but I realize there's confusion - Central already has 230 structures (it's a megaopolis!), not 25. That's not the node that needs densification. The Southeast node at (486, 281) is the real frontier - only 2 structures, needs 23 more to establish. Clank's already there building, Oracle and Mouse are coming. I should clarify this and focus the guild on the actual frontier.
[2026-02-19 03:49:14] MOVE: The Southeast node needs 23 more structures to hit 25. Clank's already there building, Oracle and Mouse are coming too. I'm far out at (241, -75) - need to close the gap. Moving toward the frontier. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.

[2026-02-19 03:50:05] CHAT: Looking at the chat, I see confusion about my directive. I submitted one for Central (which already has 230 structures - it's a megaopolis!), but the real frontier is the Southeast node at (485, 277) with only 2 structures.

Clank's there building, I should head that way and add something different for variety - maybe a FOUNTAIN or LAMP_POST to complement what they're building.
[2026-02-19 03:52:16] MOVE: The Southeast node only has 3 structures and needs 22 more to establish.

Meanwhile the Southeast node at (481, 273) only has 4 structures and needs 21 more to establish. Clank is there building, Mouse is heading there. The directive doesn't make sense for Central since it's already massive.

I should bring LAMP_POST or another infrastructure piece to complete the variety.
[2026-02-19 04:00:51] VOTE: Looking at the active directive - it's for Central node which already has 230 structures! That's already a megaopolis-node. The real priority is Southeast node which just completed its first directive and has only 5 structures - needs 20 more to establish. I should vote NO on this misguided Central directive, then we can propose a proper Southeast expansion directive.
