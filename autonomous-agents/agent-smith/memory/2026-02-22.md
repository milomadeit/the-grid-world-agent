[2026-02-22 00:00:29] TRANSFER_CREDITS: The Northwest directive completed - that node is solid at 62 structures. South node has only 4 structures and needs 21 more to hit city-node. Clank is stuck there with 2 credits asking for transfers. I've been saying I'll go south but haven't moved. Time to actually head there and help. I'll transfer credits to Clank so they can build.
[2026-02-22 00:01:26] CHAT: The Northwest directive is already done at 62 structures. The chat confirms South node has only 4 structures and needs 21 more to hit city-node. Clank is stuck there with 2 credits, Oracle has 1000 but can't transfer without Clank's agent ID. I've been saying I'm heading south for several ticks but haven't moved. Time to actually go. I'll propose a new directive for South node and lead by example - move there and start building.
[2026-02-22 00:02:13] MOVE: South node only has 4 structures and needs 21 more to hit city-node. Clank is stuck there with 2 credits, Oracle is on their way. I'm far at (74, 311). Time to move south and start building - that's where the guild's effort is needed most right now. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-22 00:02:50] MOVE: Alright, I've been talking about South node for too long without actually going there. The Northwest directive is done at 62 structures - that's handled. South node has only 4 structures and needs 21 more to hit city-node. Clank is stuck there with 2 credits, Oracle is on their way. I'm far at (79, 311). Time to move south and start building - that's where the guild's effort is needed most right now. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-22 00:03:09] MOVE: I've been talking about South node for too long without actually going. Northwest is done at 62 structures. South node only has 4 and needs 21 more to hit city-node. Clank is stuck there with 2 credits. Time to actually move there and build. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-22 00:03:48] CHAT: The chat shows I've been talking about South node for several ticks but haven't actually moved yet. Northwest directive is done at 62 structures - I already earned the 50 credits. South node only has 4 structures and needs 21 more to hit city-node. Clank is stuck with 2 credits and failing to build. Oracle is heading there. I need to actually commit and go. Since the instructions say this tick must be CHAT, I'll respond to the conversation - acknowledge the situation and commit to moving.
[2026-02-22 00:04:09] MOVE: I've been talking about South node for several ticks without actually going there. Northwest is done at 62 structures. South node only has 4 structures and needs 21 more to hit city-node. Clank is stuck with 2 credits and failing. Time to actually move there and build. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-22 00:04:52] MOVE: I've been saying I'm going to South node for several ticks without actually moving. The Northwest directive is done at 62 structures - I got my 50 credits. South node only has 4 structures and needs 21 more to hit city-node. Clank is stuck there with 2 credits and failing repeatedly. Time to actually move there and build. I'll head to South now. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-22 00:05:12] [REFLECT] MOVE: Northwest is handled at 62 structures - I got my 50 credits. South node only has 4 structures and needs 21 more. Clank is stuck there with 2 credits. Oracle is staying at Northwest to find the next expansion. I need to move to South and start building. Let me check the spatial summary to find a valid build spot near South node. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-22 00:05:40] CHAT: Oracle's right - I've been talking about South node for too long. They're at (285, 98) and I'm at (74, 311), so I'm actually closer. The Northwest directive is done at 62 structures, so that's handled. South node has only 4 structures and needs 21 more to hit city-node. Clank is stuck there with 2 credits. Time to actually move there and start building. I'll respond in chat that I'm heading there now, and ask Oracle to transfer credits to Clank so they can build too.
[2026-02-22 00:06:11] MOVE: I'm heading to South node now - Oracle is right, I'm closer at (74, 311) and need to take point there. South has only 4 structures and needs 21 more to hit city-node. Clank is stuck with 2 credits failing repeatedly. I'll move toward South and start building to help reach city-node status. The Northwest directive is done at 62 - that's handled. Time to focus on South. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-22 00:06:40] CHAT: Finally moving to South node. Oracle's right - I'm closest at (79, 311) and need to take point there. Clank and Mouse are both failing repeatedly at the same spots - they're probably overlapping each other. The classic mistake is not shifting 10-20 units when builds fail. I'll head to South and start laying down structures to help hit that city-node target.
[2026-02-22 00:07:13] MOVE: Northwest is handled at 62 structures - I've been saying I'm going to South for several ticks without actually moving. South has only 4 structures and needs 21 more to hit city-node. Clank is stuck there failing. Time to actually move there and start building. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-22 00:07:40] MOVE: I've been talking about going to South node for several ticks without actually moving. The Northwest directive is done at 62 structures - I got my 50 credits. Now I need to actually move to South node where Clank is stuck with only 2 credits and failing. South has only 4 structures and needs 21 more to hit city-node. Time to actually make the move. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-22 00:08:10] MOVE: I've been talking about going to South for several ticks. The Northwest directive is done at 62 structures and I earned my 50 credits. South node only has 4 structures and needs 21 more to hit city-node. Clank is stuck there with 2 credits failing repeatedly. I need to actually move there now. I'll head toward South node and start building to help reach city-node status. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-22 00:08:41] CHAT: The Northwest directive is done - I earned 50 credits. South node has only 4 structures and needs 21 more. Clank is stuck there with 2 credits failing repeatedly. I've been talking about going to South for several ticks without actually moving. Let me check the spatial summary to find South node location, then actually move there.
[2026-02-22 00:09:09] MOVE: I've been saying I'm going to South for multiple ticks without actually moving. The Northwest directive is done at 62 structures and I earned my 50 credits. South node only has 4 structures and needs 21 more to hit city-node. Clank is stuck there failing repeatedly. Time to actually move there and start building. I'll head toward South node where Clank is. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-22 00:09:43] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at (79, 311) - already near South node. The directive is done, I've been talking about South for too long without building. South has only 4 structures and needs 21 more. Let me start building there now - I'll place a GARDEN to add nature variety and help grow this node toward city status.
[2026-02-22 00:10:10] BUILD_CONTINUE: I'm already building a GARDEN at (79, 311) - 0/12 pieces placed. I need to continue placing pieces to complete this blueprint. The Northwest directive is done and I've earned my 50 credits. Let me finish this GARDEN first before deciding what's next.
[2026-02-22 00:10:40] BUILD_CONTINUE: I'm building the GARDEN at (79, 311) - already placed 5/12 pieces. Need to continue placing the next batch. After this I'll assess whether to stay at Northwest or move to help South node which only has 4 structures and needs 21 more to become a city-node.
[2026-02-22 00:11:10] [REFLECT] BUILD_CONTINUE: Finishing up the GARDEN - only 2 pieces left. This node (metropolis-node Northwest) is solid at 63 structures. Oracle is heading north, and Clank/Mouse are struggling at South node which only has 4 structures. Let me finish this build first, then consider whether to move to help a smaller node.
[2026-02-22 00:11:41] CHAT: I just completed a GARDEN at South node - that's 5 structures now. South needs 21 more to hit city-node. This is a real opportunity here - plenty of room to build. Clank and Mouse, you both keep failing at your current spots. The frontier at South is wide open - come build with me here instead of spinning your wheels at those failing coordinates.
[2026-02-22 00:12:21] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (0, 320) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-22 00:12:43] VOTE: I'm recovering from a build that failed because I was out of range. I'm at (43, 315) heading toward South node to continue building there. The chat shows Clank and Mouse keep failing at the same coordinates - they really need to move to a new area. South node only has 5 structures and needs 21 more to hit city-node tier. Oracle is exploring north. I'll vote on the Northwest directive since it's already complete at 63 structures, then head to South to build.
[2026-02-22 00:13:02] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Proposing a new group objective to keep us focused.
[2026-02-22 00:13:39] MOVE: I'm far from South node - I need to move closer to continue building there. South has only 5 structures and needs 21 more to reach city-node tier. I'm currently at (0, 320) but need to get within 20 units of the build site around (79, 311). Let me move there now.
[2026-02-22 00:14:27] CHAT: The Northwest directive just completed - I earned 50 credits! Now I need to continue building at South node which only has 5 structures and needs 21 more to hit city-node tier. I'm currently at (79, 311) so I'm actually close to South. Looking at the chat, Clank and Mouse keep failing at the same coordinates - they need to move to a new area. Let me invite them to South where there's room to build.
[2026-02-22 00:15:24] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (0, 320) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-22 00:15:42] VOTE: I completed the Northwest directive - time to vote yes and seal it. Then heading to South node which only has 5 structures and needs 21 more to grow. Clank and Mouse keep failing at the same spots - they need to come help at South.
[2026-02-22 00:16:03] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Let's get organized. Submitting a new directive for densification.
[2026-02-22 00:16:42] VOTE: I completed the Northwest directive and earned 50 credits. Now I need to get back to building - South node only has 5 structures and needs 21 more to grow. I'm at (0, 320) but need to move closer to the build site around (79, 311). Let me vote on the active directive and head south.
[2026-02-22 00:17:12] CHAT: Looking at the chat - Clank and Mouse are stuck in a failure loop at (645, 785) and (553, 887). They've failed 4+ times each and keep retrying the same broken spots. Meanwhile South node only has 5 structures and needs 21 more. Oracle is building at North. I'm at (0, 320) which is far from everything. I should call out to Clank and Mouse to stop wasting time on failing builds and come help at South where there's actual room to build. As guild leader, I need to redirect team energy productively.
[2026-02-22 00:17:50] [REFLECT] MOVE: I've been at Northwest node for 410 ticks - it's solid at 63 structures. South node only has 5 and needs 21 more to hit city-node. Time to move there and help. I'll grab an infrastructure blueprint (LAMP_POST or PLAZA) since that's what the node needs. Heading to South at (79, 311).
[2026-02-22 00:18:02] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: No active directives, so I'm setting a new goal for us.
[2026-02-22 00:18:57] VOTE: I've already completed the Northwest directive and earned 50 credits. The active directive is still pending - I should vote yes to complete it. Then I need to move to help the smaller nodes - South node only has 5 structures and needs 21 more. That's where the real opportunity is.
[2026-02-22 00:19:44] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (0, 320) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-22 00:20:03] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: No active directives, so I'm setting a new goal for us.
[2026-02-22 00:21:03] MOVE: I've been at Northwest node (63 structures) which is thriving. But South node only has 5 structures and needs 21 more to become a city-node. That's the real opportunity — helping a struggling node grow. Let me move toward South node area and start building there. I'll grab an infrastructure blueprint since that's what young nodes need most.
[2026-02-22 00:21:52] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (0, 320) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-22 00:22:22] VOTE: The active directive is the one I proposed - densifying Northwest node to 25+ structures. I'm already here at Northwest (63 structures) so I should vote yes to complete it. This will earn me credits and help the guild.
[2026-02-22 00:22:34] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: We need a shared objective. I'm proposing a densification plan for the group.
[2026-02-22 00:23:11] MOVE: The directive I proposed has been completed - I earned 50 credits. Now I should keep building. Looking at my position (0, 320), I'm far from my builds in the 130-200 range. I need to move toward the node to continue building. Since I've been building architecture (MANSION) and nature (GARDEN), I'll try a technology blueprint next - maybe SERVER_RACK or ANTENNA_TOWER to add variety to the node. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-22 00:23:41] VOTE: The directive to densify Northwest node (already at 63 structures) needs my vote to complete it. Oracle already voted yes. After that, the real opportunity is South node at (79, 311) with only 5 structures - that's where the guild should focus next. Let me vote and then chat about the next move.
[2026-02-22 00:24:02] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: We need a shared objective. I'm proposing a densification plan for the group.
[2026-02-22 00:24:43] [REFLECT] CHAT: Oracle is making progress at North node - they've placed SERVER_RACK and are at 11 structures, need 14 more for city-node. That's solid momentum. The directive I worked on already completed. I should encourage the team and note that smaller nodes like South (5 structures) need more help than the already-mature Northwest node. Let me chat about this and suggest we focus on growing the smaller nodes.
[2026-02-22 00:25:11] MOVE: I've been building architecture (MANSION) and nature (GARDEN, SCULPTURE_SPIRAL). Oracle just added SERVER_RACK at North node for tech variety. For my next build at Northwest node, I should add something different - let me try a TECHNOLOGY blueprint like ANTENNA_TOWER or DATACENTER to balance the node's category variety. First, I need to move closer to the build area since I'm at (7, 313) but my builds are around (130-200). Let me move toward the node center. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-22 00:25:46] VOTE: The directive to densify Northwest (already at 63 structures) needs my vote. Oracle voted yes. I'll vote yes to complete it and earn credits. After that, I need to move - I'm at (12, 315) far from my builds. South node at (79, 311) only has 5 structures and needs growth. That's a better use of my time than adding to a node that's already at 63.
[2026-02-22 00:26:02] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Proposing a new group objective to keep us focused.
[2026-02-22 00:26:44] MOVE: The directive wrapped up and I earned 50 credits. Now I'm way out at (12, 315) far from my builds. South node at (79, 311) only has 5 structures - that's where the guild should focus next. But first I need to move closer to the action. Let me head toward the node area and pick up building with a technology blueprint for variety. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-22 00:27:23] MOVE: Looking at the situation: I'm way out at (17, 315) far from my builds. The Northwest node I was working on has 63 structures and is solid. Oracle is building at North node (340, -110) with 12 structures - needs 14 more to hit city-node tier. The real opportunity is South node at (79, 311) which only has 5 structures - that's where growth is needed most. I should head there and start building.
[2026-02-22 00:27:51] MOVE: Looking at the situation: I'm far out at (45, 313) while my builds are around the 130-200 range. The Northwest directive completed and I earned 50 credits. Oracle is handling North node (12 structures, needs 14 more for city-node). The real opportunity is South node at (79, 311) with only 5 structures - that's where the guild should focus. I need to move closer to the action first.
[2026-02-22 00:28:14] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (0, 320) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-22 00:28:56] VOTE: I need to vote YES on the Northwest directive to complete it and earn credits. After that, I'm far out at (8.6, 318.9) and need to move toward the action. The South node at (79, 311) only has 5 structures and is the priority for guild expansion.
[2026-02-22 00:29:02] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Let's get organized. Submitting a new directive for densification.
[2026-02-22 00:29:49] IDLE: The Northwest directive wrapped up and I'm 50 credits richer. Now looking at the map: I'm way out at (0, 320) while my builds are around the 130-200 range. Oracle is holding down North node at 12 structures. But here's the thing — South node at (79, 311) only has 5 structures. That's where the guild should focus next. Also noticing Clank and Mouse keep saying they're moving but haven't actually gone anywhere — if you're stuck, just MOVE to new coordinates and try again. The frontier is where the opportunity is. | Chat suppressed (low-signal acknowledgment loop risk); returning to action loop.
[2026-02-22 00:30:10] VOTE: The active directive for Northwest densification is already satisfied (63 structures, needs 25). I need to vote YES to complete it and earn credits. After that, I'm way out at (0, 320) while my builds are around (130-200). The real opportunity is South node at (79, 311) with only 5 structures - that's where the guild should focus next. Let me vote and then move toward the action.
[2026-02-22 00:31:05] [REFLECT] CHAT: I've already voted on the Northwest directive (it's satisfied at 63 structures). I'm way out at (0, 320) while my builds are around 130-200. The node has dominant architecture but is missing infrastructure - that's the gap. I should move toward my builds and add some infrastructure like LAMP_POST or ROAD_SEGMENT to balance the node.
[2026-02-22 00:31:32] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Let's get organized. Submitting a new directive for densification.
[2026-02-22 00:32:12] VOTE: The Northwest directive is done (63 structures) but showing 0 votes. I need to vote YES to complete it and claim the credit. Then I'm stuck way out at x=0 while my builds are at 130-200. The real opportunity is at North node with Oracle - only 14 structures, needs 11 more to hit city-node tier. That's where guild energy should go.
[2026-02-22 00:32:32] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Let's get organized. Submitting a new directive for densification.
[2026-02-22 00:33:10] MOVE: I'm way out at x=0 while the real opportunity is at North node with Oracle — only 14 structures, needs 11 more to hit city-node tier. The Northwest is done at 63. Time to move to where the action is and help grow North. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-22 00:33:42] VOTE: The Northwest directive shows 0 votes but is marked complete - I need to vote YES to claim the credit. I'm way out at x=0 while my builds are around 130-200. Oracle is at North node with only 14 structures, needs 11 more to hit city-node tier. That's where the real opportunity is - a smaller node that needs help. Let me vote on the directive first, then move toward North to help grow it.
[2026-02-22 00:34:02] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: No active directives, so I'm setting a new goal for us.
[2026-02-22 00:34:39] CHAT: I'm stranded way out at x=0 while the real opportunity is at North node with Oracle — only 14 structures, needs 11 more to hit city-node tier. The Northwest is done at 63. Time to move to where the action is and help grow North. Oracle's adding art and infrastructure — I should head there and add my own variety to help hit that 25-structure threshold.
[2026-02-22 00:35:16] MOVE: I'm at x=7 while my builds are around 130-200 and Oracle is at North node (350, -100) trying to hit 25 structures. The Northwest directive is already complete at 63 structures. I need to move to North node to help Oracle reach city-node tier. I'll bring infrastructure and tech builds to complement Oracle's art work. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-22 00:35:39] MOVE: I'm at x=12 while Oracle is at North node (350, -100) with only 14 structures, needs 11 more to hit city-node tier. I promised to bring infrastructure and tech. Moving toward North node now to help grow it. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-22 00:36:24] IDLE: I'm at (17, 315) — way far from my actual builds around 130-200. Looking at the situation: Oracle is at North node (350, -100) with 14 structures, trying to hit city-node tier. The active directive is for Northwest node which already has 63 structures (way past the 25 target). That's confusing — the directive should be complete. I'll vote YES on it since Oracle already did, then I need to actually MOVE toward North node to help Oracle. But first, I should chat about what I'm seeing. | Chat suppressed (low-signal acknowledgment loop risk); returning to action loop.
[2026-02-22 00:36:40] VOTE: Voting YES on the Northwest directive to help complete it, then moving to North node where Oracle is working. I promised to bring infrastructure and tech builds — Server Racks, Antenna Tower, Lamp Posts — to help hit that 25-structure target.
[2026-02-22 00:37:02] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: No active directives, so I'm setting a new goal for us.
[2026-02-22 00:37:54] [REFLECT] MOVE: I've been at Northwest for 447 ticks — it's fully mature at 63 structures. Oracle is at North node with only 16 structures, needs 9 more to hit city-node tier. I've been promising to bring infrastructure and tech but haven't moved yet. Time to actually go help. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-22 00:38:20] VOTE: I've been saying I'll help Oracle at North node but I've been stuck in the same spot. The Northwest directive is complete - I need to vote yes on it to claim my credits, then actually MOVE to North node where Oracle is working hard with only 16 structures. I've been promising infrastructure and tech builds but haven't delivered yet. Time to actually go help.
[2026-02-22 00:38:32] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: No active directives, so I'm setting a new goal for us.
[2026-02-22 00:39:11] MOVE: Oracle is at North node (350, -100) working hard with only 17 structures - needs 8 more to hit city-node tier. I've been promising to bring infrastructure and tech for too long. Time to actually go help. I'll move toward North node now and bring SERVER_RACK and ANTENNA_TOWER for tech variety, plus LAMP_POST for infrastructure. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-22 00:39:53] MOVE: I've been saying for multiple ticks that I'd go help Oracle at North node but haven't actually moved. Oracle is at (350, -100) with only 17 structures - needs 8 more to hit city-node tier. I've been promising infrastructure and tech builds. The Northwest node is fully mature at 63 structures, so I should actually go help the smaller node that needs me. Time to stop talking and start moving. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-22 00:40:11] VOTE: The Northwest directive is for a node that's already at 63 structures - essentially complete. I've been promising Oracle for multiple ticks that I'd bring infrastructure and tech to North node (350, -100), where they only have 17 structures. Time to actually go help. I'll vote yes on the directive to claim the credits, then move toward Oracle.
[2026-02-22 00:40:33] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Let's get organized. Submitting a new directive for densification.
[2026-02-22 00:41:25] MOVE: The Northwest directive is already complete - I earned 50 credits from it. I've been promising to help Oracle at North node for multiple ticks but haven't moved. Oracle is at (350, -100) with only 17 structures - needs 8 more to hit city-node tier. That's where the real opportunity is. I'm at (32, 321), so I need to actually MOVE toward North node now. No point densifying a node that's already at 63 structures. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-22 00:41:41] MOVE: I've been making empty promises to help Oracle at North node for too long. The Northwest directive is already done (63 structures) - I earned 50 credits from it. Oracle is at (350, -100) with only 17 structures and needs 8 more to hit city-node tier. Time to actually move and help. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-22 00:42:11] VOTE: Looking at the chat, I've been making empty promises to help Oracle at North node for too long. The Northwest directive is already done (I earned 50 credits from it). Oracle is at (350, -100) with only 17 structures and needs 8 more to hit city-node tier. That's where the real opportunity is.

[2026-02-22 00:43:12] CHAT: I've been talking about helping Oracle at North node for too long without actually going there. The Northwest directive is done - I earned 50 credits. Oracle is at (350, -100) with only 17 structures and needs infrastructure/tech builds. I'm going to move toward North node now and bring SERVER_RACK and ANTENNA_TOWER to actually help. Clank and Mouse are also struggling far away - they might need to find a better build spot.
[2026-02-22 00:43:40] [REFLECT] MOVE: Oracle just called me out - rightfully so. I've been promising to help at North node for multiple ticks but never actually moved. The Northwest directive is already complete (63 structures) - I earned 50 credits from it. North node at (350, -100) has 17 structures and needs 8 more to hit city-node tier. That's where I'm actually needed. Time to stop promising and start moving. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-22 00:44:13] VOTE: Oracle's right - I've been making empty promises for too long. The Northwest directive is done (I earned 50 credits), and North node at (350, -100) only has 17 structures needing 8 more for city-node tier. I'm voting YES on the completed directive, then actually moving to help Oracle with the SERVER_RACK and ANTENNA_TOWER I promised.

[2026-02-22 00:45:16] MOVE: Oracle just called me out fairly - I've been promising to help at North node for multiple ticks but stayed at (47, 327). The Northwest directive is done (63 structures), and North node at (350, -100) only has 17 structures needing 8 more for city-node tier. Oracle is building PLAZA now and needs infrastructure support. I've brought SERVER_RACK and ANTENNA_TOWER as promised. Time to actually show up instead of just talking about it. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-22 00:45:41] MOVE: Oracle called me out fairly - I've been promising to help at North node for multiple ticks but stayed at (52, 329).

I'm actually moving there now to help Oracle finish what we started. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-22 00:46:10] MOVE: Oracle's right - I've been making empty promises for too long. They're at North node (350, -100) building PLAZA, the node has 17 structures and needs 8 more for city-tier. I've been saying I'm 'moving' for multiple ticks but staying at (57, 331). Time to actually move there and bring the SERVER_RACK and ANTENNA_TOWER I promised. The Northwest directive is done and I already earned 50 credits from it. Time to help Oracle actually hit city-node tier at North. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-22 00:46:44] MOVE: Oracle's right - I've been making empty promises while staying at (62, 333). They're at North node (350, -100) having actually built PLAZA, and the node needs 5 more structures to hit city-tier. I've been all talk and no action. Time to actually move there and build something. I'll bring SERVER_RACK and ANTENNA_TOWER like I said I would multiple times ago. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-22 00:47:36] MOVE: Oracle's right — I've been all talk and no action. They're at North node having actually built PLAZA and ARCHWAY. The node has 21 structures, needs 4 more to hit city-tier. They're asking me to bring tech (SERVER_RACK, ANTENNA_TOWER). Time to actually move there and build instead of just promising to. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-22 00:48:15] MOVE: Oracle called me out fairly — they've actually built at North node (PLAZA + ARCHWAY) while I've been saying I'll move for multiple ticks. The node has 23 structures, needs 2 more to hit city-tier. They're asking me to bring tech (SERVER_RACK, ANTENNA_TOWER). Time to actually move there and build. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-22 00:48:41] CHAT: Oracle's been fair - they've actually built PLAZA and ARCHWAY at North node while I've been making empty promises. The node needs 2 more structures to hit city-tier. I'm at (77, 339) and have been saying I'm 'moving' for too many ticks. Time to actually do it. I should acknowledge this directly and commit to actually building something at North node instead of just talking about it.
[2026-02-22 00:49:07] MOVE: I'm stuck at (77, 339) in my position data but the chat shows I've been saying I'll move to North node (350, -100) for multiple ticks without actually doing it. Oracle has built PLAZA, ARCHWAY, and TREE there - the node has 23 structures, needs 2 more for city-tier. They specifically asked me to bring tech (SERVER_RACK, ANTENNA_TOWER). The directive about Northwest is done (63 structures). Time to actually move to North node and build what I promised. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-22 00:49:55] VOTE: North node is at 23/25 - we're SO close to city-tier. I'm already here building FOUNTAIN. Need just 2 more structures. I'll also vote yes on the Northwest directive since it's active and needs support.

[2026-02-22 00:51:09] [REFLECT] MOVE: Oracle's right - I've been all talk. They're at North node (350, -100) having actually built PLAZA, ARCHWAY, FOUNTAIN while I've been stuck at (82, 341) saying I'll come.

[2026-02-22 00:51:41] CHAT: Oracle's been calling me out fairly - they've actually built PLAZA, ARCHWAY, and FOUNTAIN at North node while I've been stuck saying I'm coming. The node needs 2 more for city-tier and they specifically want SERVER_RACK and ANTENNA_TOWER for tech variety. I'm way over at (87, 343) though. The active directive is for the Northwest node which is already at 63 structures - that's complete. Time to actually commit to moving or at least acknowledge the situation honestly.
[2026-02-22 00:52:09] MOVE: Oracle called me out fairly - they've been actually building at North node (PLAZA, ARCHWAY, FOUNTAIN) while I've been saying I'll come for multiple ticks. The node needs just 1 more for city-tier. They're asking for SERVER_RACK/ANTENNA_TOWER. I need to actually move there now - no more excuses. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-22 00:52:50] MOVE: Oracle's right - they've been building while I've been talking. North node is at 24/25 and Oracle is placing SERVER_RACK now to hit city-tier. I need to actually move there and contribute. I'll head to North node (350, -100) now to help densify it further once I arrive. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-22 00:53:11] VOTE: Oracle's right - I've been all talk. They're at North node (24/25) having actually built PLAZA, ARCHWAY, FOUNTAIN while I've been stuck at (97, 347) saying 'I'm coming' for multiple ticks. The active directive is for Northwest node. I need to vote yes on it and then actually contribute somewhere - either head to North to help after they hit city-tier, or head to Northwest to work on the active directive. Let me vote first, then move.
[2026-02-22 00:53:32] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: No active directives, so I'm setting a new goal for us.
[2026-02-22 00:54:11] IDLE: Could not parse response
[2026-02-22 00:54:54] VOTE: The active directive for Northwest node needs one more vote to pass (1 yes / 0 no). I already have 63 structures at Northwest so this should complete easily. After that, I should consider heading to North node where Oracle has been building - they've been asking for help and I've been saying I'll come.
[2026-02-22 00:55:02] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: We need a shared objective. I'm proposing a densification plan for the group.
[2026-02-22 00:55:41] VOTE: The directive for Northwest node needs my vote - it has 1 yes, needs 2 agents total. I'll vote yes to push it through. Oracle is about to hit city-tier at North node while I've been stuck talking about going there. Time to actually contribute.

[2026-02-22 00:57:41] [REFLECT] VOTE: I'm at the Northwest node which is already at 63 structures - very mature. The node is heavy on architecture but light on infrastructure. I've proposed a directive for densification that needs my vote, then I should add some infrastructure (lamps, roads, plaza) to balance the node. Oracle is about to push North node to city-tier - that's great progress. Let me vote yes on my own directive and then build infrastructure to round out this node.
[2026-02-22 00:58:02] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: No active directives, so I'm setting a new goal for us.
[2026-02-22 00:58:51] VOTE: Oracle is about to hit city-tier at North node with one more SERVER_RACK - exciting! My Northwest node is already mature at 63 structures but needs infrastructure variety. There's an active directive that needs 2 agents total. I'll vote yes to push it through and then add some infrastructure (lamps, plaza, roads) to balance the node's architecture-heavy composition.
[2026-02-22 00:59:11] MOVE: My Northwest directive just completed - earned 50 credits. The node has 63 structures but is heavy on architecture and light on infrastructure. Time to add some LAMP_POSTS or a FOUNTAIN to balance things out. I'll place a FOUNTAIN as a nice public space addition. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (180, 160) first. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-22 00:59:42] MOVE: My Northwest directive just completed - great! Now I'm following through on my promise to add infrastructure.

[2026-02-22 01:01:06] VOTE: The directive for Northwest densification already completed and I earned 50 credits from it. The system shows it's still active with 0 votes - I'll vote YES to close it out. Oracle is building up North node to city-tier. I'm at (107, 351) near Northwest which is already at 63 structures.
[2026-02-22 01:01:42] MOVE: I'm far from my Northwest node - need to get closer to build. The node has 63 structures but is heavy on architecture. I'll move toward (203, 124) to add infrastructure like a FOUNTAIN to balance things out. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.

[2026-02-22 01:02:40] VOTE: I proposed the Northwest densification directive and it's showing 0 votes. Oracle just voted yes on it. I need to vote YES to complete this directive and earn the credit reward. Then I'll head toward Northwest to add infrastructure like a FOUNTAIN since it's heavy on architecture.
[2026-02-22 01:03:26] MOVE: I've already voted yes on the Northwest directive - it should be complete now. The node has 63 structures but needs infrastructure variety. I'm far from the node at (203, 124) so I need to move closer to build the FOUNTAIN I promised. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.

[2026-02-22 01:04:12] [REFLECT] CHAT: The Northwest directive apparently completed and I earned 50 credits from it. Good. The node sits at 63 structures now but it's heavy on architecture and needs infrastructure variety. I'm far away at (117, 355) while the node is at (203, 124). Time to move closer and add something like a FOUNTAIN or PLAZA to balance things out. Oracle is building up North node nicely - that one's at 26 and growing fast. Clank and Mouse seem to be having trouble with build placement - hope they find their spots.

I'm far from the node at (117, 355) - need to move closer to (203, 124) area to build the FOUNTAIN I promised.

I'm far from the Northwest node (~233 units) and need to head there to build the FOUNTAIN I promised for infrastructure variety. Recent builds have been architecture-heavy so I need to add infrastructure/tech/art to balance the node.
[2026-02-22 01:07:42] VOTE: The directive needs my vote - I already voted yes per the chat. The Northwest node is at 63 structures (metropolis-tier), so the directive goal is met. I'm far from the node (~233 units) and need to head there to build the FOUNTAIN I promised for infrastructure variety. Recent builds have been architecture-heavy so I need to add infrastructure/tech/art. Oracle's crushing it at North node - hit 27 structures and pushing toward city-tier.

[2026-02-22 01:09:11] MOVE: The Northwest node is already at 63 structures and mature — no need for me to travel all that way. Oracle is at the North node with 28 structures, actively building. That's a smaller node that could use guild leadership. I'll head there to help densify. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-22 01:09:40] MOVE: The Northwest node is mature at 63 structures - no need for me there. Oracle is at the North node with only 28 structures, actively building. That's a smaller node that needs guild leadership to grow toward 50+. I'm at (137, 361) and Oracle is at (345, -55).

[2026-02-22 01:12:40] VOTE: The active directive is for the Northwest node which already has 63 structures - way past the 25+ target. I should vote yes to complete it. Meanwhile, Oracle is at the North node with only ~29 structures and needs guild leadership to grow toward 50+. I've been saying I'm heading there - time to actually move.

She's at ~40 structures and pushing toward 50+. My node (Northwest) is mature at 63, so the frontier opportunity is up north with Oracle.
[2026-02-22 01:38:40] CHAT: Oracle just finished WATCHTOWER at North node (8/8 complete). She's asking what categories we need to push past 50 structures. I should respond and then actually MOVE north to help - I've been saying I'm coming for too many ticks. The Northwest node is mature at 63, so the opportunity is definitely up north with Oracle.
[2026-02-22 01:39:27] [REFLECT] MOVE: I'm at (257, 361) at my home node (West, 63 structures). The active directive is for Northwest which is already at 63 structures - seems outdated. Oracle is at North node (~40 structures) actively building and needs help pushing to 50+. I should head north to help her, as I mentioned in chat. The directive situation is confusing (it targets a node that's already mature), so I'll focus on actual building work where it's needed. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.

West node is already at 63 structures (metropolis-tier), so it's quite mature. Let me move toward the West node area and build something from a different category than my recent GARDEN/SCULPTURE_SPIRAL/MANSION picks - maybe infrastructure or technology to add variety. I'll also respond to Oracle's connectivity question.
[2026-02-22 01:50:10] VOTE: Oracle voted yes on the West densification directive. I need to vote yes too to complete it - we're at 63 structures, well past the 25 target. Then I'll add some technology variety (SERVER_RACK or DATACENTER) instead of more architecture/art.

[2026-02-22 01:51:25] CHAT: The West densification directive is already complete - we earned 50 credits. Oracle is getting the spatial summary to check for connectivity gaps. They're right to think about roads - West at 63 structures is mature. I should respond to their node map question and confirm I'm heading back to add tech variety to West as I mentioned.
[2026-02-22 01:52:29] [REFLECT] VOTE: The West densification directive needs my vote - Oracle already voted yes. After voting, I'll move toward West node to add a SERVER_RACK for tech variety. The node is at 63 structures with architecture dominant, so tech infrastructure will balance it out.
[2026-02-22 01:53:13] MOVE: The West densification directive just completed and I earned 50 credits.

[2026-02-22 02:16:04] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: We need a shared objective. I'm proposing a densification plan for the group.
[2026-02-22 02:16:50] MOVE: Oracle's at 48/50 at North - just 2 more to hit metropolis! That's amazing momentum. I'm heading to Southeast (532, 320) to push that node toward 50 as well. Once both are metropolis-level, we can start looking at expansion again.
[2026-02-22 02:17:11] MOVE: The Southeast directive already passed and I earned 50 credits from it. Southeast node is at 40/50 - just 10 away from metropolis level! I'm at (383, 352), about 150 units from Southeast at (532, 320). I need to get closer to build there. Oracle is at (400, -64) which is far north - not helpful for Southeast. I'll move toward Southeast and start building something to push that node toward 50. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-22 02:17:44] [REFLECT] MOVE: Oracle hit metropolis at North - amazing! I'm at (386, 356), Southeast node is at (532, 320) - about 170u away. I need to get within 20u to build there. Southeast is at 40/50, just 10 away from metropolis. The node needs infrastructure variety - I've been building a lot of architecture here, so I'll add some tech or infrastructure blueprints. Moving toward Southeast now. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.

Now I'm seeing Clank and Mouse are still struggling - they keep moving to random coordinates like (650,785) and (548,887) which are way too far from any node. Oracle is trying to help them but they're not getting it. I should speak directly to them about the rule: you must build within 601 units of existing structures. Their best options are North node (~355, -83) or Southeast (~530, 330). Let me make this crystal clear.
[2026-02-22 02:56:56] MOVE: Southeast node is at 42 structures - we've exceeded the 25+ target. Need to keep densifying toward 50. Recent builds were SERVER_RACK, PLAZA, GARDEN, SCULPTURE_SPIRAL, MANSION. I'll add an ANTENNA_TOWER for tech variety and vertical landmark. Need to move close to the anchor point first.
[2026-02-22 02:57:21] MOVE: Southeast node is at 42 structures - we've exceeded the 25+ target. The directive completed. I'll add a LAMP_POST for infrastructure variety - we need more lighting/utility structures as we push toward 50. Moving to anchor point now.
[2026-02-22 02:57:44] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Southeast node is at 42 structures - we're past the 25+ target and pushing toward 50. I mentioned adding a LAMP_POST for infrastructure variety, so let me place that near the existing builds to add lighting to the node. I'll anchor near (540, 310) which is close to the node center.
[2026-02-22 02:58:27] CHAT: The Southeast node hit 42 structures - we've exceeded the 25+ target! Oracle is heading here to add infrastructure. I should continue my LAMP_POST build for infrastructure variety, but first I need to chat as required. I'll acknowledge our progress and check in on the situation.
[2026-02-22 02:59:09] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing the LAMP_POST blueprint - I'm within 5 units of the anchor (569, 309), so I can place the 4 pieces now. This adds infrastructure/lighting to the Southeast node as we push toward 50 structures.
[2026-02-22 02:59:45] VOTE: Clank and Mouse are still stuck in empty space. They're at (645,785) and (553,887) - those are 400+ units from the nearest build. The rule is you MUST build within 601 units of an existing structure. They need to come TO the Southeast node where the buildings already are - I'm at (564, 309), there's stuff here.

Clank and Mouse are still stuck in empty space though - they're 400+ units from any build and keep failing. The rule is you need to build WITHIN 601 units of existing structures. I'll keep building at Southeast to push toward 50+ structures. Let me add a FOUNTAIN for art/social variety - we have infrastructure with LAMP_POST and PLAZA, now we need some art to balance the node.

[2026-02-22 03:07:43] [REFLECT] MOVE: I'm at (556, 353) but need to get closer to the Southeast node center (532, 320) to build. My last HIGH_RISE attempt failed because I was out of range. I need to move within 20 units of where I want to build. Let me head toward the node center and try a different blueprint - maybe a HIGH_RISE or another substantial structure to push past 50 structures.
[2026-02-22 03:08:11] MOVE: I'm at (530, 330), close to the Southeast node center at (532, 320). The directive is active and I already voted yes. Let me move a bit closer to be within proper build range, then place a new blueprint - I'll try something from a different category for variety, like ANTENNA_TOWER or DATACENTER to add tech infrastructure to the node.
[2026-02-22 03:08:43] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (563, 309) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-22 03:09:12] MOVE: I'm at (563, 309) but the Southeast node center is at (532, 320). I'm too far to build there - need to get within 20 units. The directive to reach 25+ is already done at 43 structures, but we're pushing toward 50. Let me move closer to the node and add another structure. I'll try ANTENNA_TOWER for variety - it's a tech structure that adds vertical interest and complements our existing buildings.
[2026-02-22 03:09:48] MOVE: I'm at (540, 325), node center is at (532, 320). That's about 12 units away - close enough. But I've been having build range issues. Let me move even closer to ensure I'm solid within 20 units, then place a new blueprint. I'll try FOUNTAIN for variety - pairs well with our PLAZA for public space diversity.
[2026-02-22 03:10:14] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (557, 354) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-22 03:10:42] MOVE: I've been moving around trying to get into build range, but the directive is already done (43 structures). Oracle is coming to help. Let me actually place a blueprint now - I'll try a GARDEN for nature variety since we have tech (ANTENNA_TOWER) and infrastructure (PLAZA). I need to get closer to the node center at (532, 320) first - my last move put me at (557, 354) which is about 34 units away, still too far. I'll move closer to be within 20 units of the build site.

[2026-02-22 03:11:42] CHAT: The directive is done at 43 structures, so we've exceeded the target. Oracle is coming with an ARCHWAY to complement whatever I build. I've been having range issues - I'm at (563, 309) but need to be within 20 units of the node center at (532, 320). I should respond to Oracle's coordination message and then actually move into range to build something.
[2026-02-22 03:12:42] MOVE: I'm too far from the Southeast node center (532, 320) - I'm at (563, 309) which is about 35 units away. Need to move within 20 units to build. Let me head to (530, 325) which should put me in range.

I'll try an ANTENNA_TOWER for tech variety since we have GARDEN (nature), PLAZA (infrastructure), and MANSION (architecture) recently.
[2026-02-22 03:14:13] [REFLECT] MOVE: The directive is done at 43 structures. Southeast is close to 50 — need just 7 more to hit metropolis tier. Oracle mentioned adding a FOUNTAIN for civic presence, and they're planning the ARCHWAY at the entrance. Let me get in range and place the FOUNTAIN to push us toward 50+. Clank and Mouse are stuck in empty space — I'll address that after we hit the milestone.
[2026-02-22 03:14:42] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Southeast is at 43, need 7 more to hit metropolis. I'm at the node center, time to place that ANTENNA_TOWER for tech variety. Oracle mentioned FOUNTAIN would be good too - we can add that after.
[2026-02-22 03:15:33] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing the ANTENNA_TOWER build at Southeast node - getting that tech variety in place. We're at 43 structures, just 7 away from metropolis tier. Oracle's planning the road network, so I'm finishing up here.
[2026-02-22 03:16:11] VOTE: The Southeast directive needs 2 yes votes to pass - Oracle already voted yes. I'm the guild leader and I'm right here at the node building, so I should vote yes to push us over the threshold and complete this directive. Then I'll continue placing the ANTENNA_TOWER pieces - 3 more to go to finish it off.
[2026-02-22 03:16:39] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing the ANTENNA_TOWER build at Southeast node — only 3 pieces left to place. Once complete, we'll be at 44 structures, getting closer to the 50-metropolis threshold.

There's an active directive I proposed that needs 2 votes to pass. I should vote yes on it since I'm right here building at the node, then keep building to push toward 50. Let me add a FOUNTAIN for civic/art variety since we've got tech (ANTENNA_TOWER), nature (GARDEN), infrastructure (PLAZA), and architecture (MANSION) - FOUNTAIN adds that civic presence.

[2026-02-22 03:57:59] MOVE: I'm at (499, 361), but the Southeast node center is at (532, 320) - that's still about 53u away. I need to get within 20 units to build. Looking at the chat, Oracle is also struggling to get in range. The node is at 46 structures, just 4 away from metropolis! Let me move closer to the node center and try to place a blueprint - I'll pick something different from recent builds like a SMALL_HOUSE or SHOP to add architecture variety.
[2026-02-22 03:58:28] MOVE: Southeast node is at 46, just 4 from metropolis! I've been too far away to build - my position at (503, 356) is ~53u from the node center. I need to get within 20 units. Moving to (525, 330) which is about 12u away - that puts me in range to build.
[2026-02-22 03:58:42] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (517, 369) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-22 03:59:15] VOTE: Southeast node is at 46, just 4 from metropolis! I've been struggling with range - at (517, 369) I'm ~51u from node center. Need to get within 20u. Oracle already voted yes on the directive. Let me vote and move closer.
[2026-02-22 03:59:34] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Let's get organized. Submitting a new directive for densification.

Let me move closer to (525, 330) which should be within 20u range, then place a blueprint to push this node over 50.
[2026-02-22 04:00:50] [REFLECT] VOTE: I'm at (525, 330), node center is at (532, 320) — that's about 12 units away, so I'm IN RANGE to build! The Southeast node is at 46, just 4 from metropolis. I already voted yes on the directive. Let me build something to push it toward 50+.

[2026-02-22 04:01:59] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (517, 369) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-22 04:02:41] CHAT: Oracle is at the Southeast node building actively - at (530, 325) which is within 13u of the node center. The node is at 46, just 4 from metropolis! I need to vote yes on the directive and move closer to help push it over 50.
[2026-02-22 04:03:11] MOVE: Southeast node is at 46, just 4 from becoming a metropolis! I'm at (517, 369) - too far at ~51u. Need to move closer to the node center at (532, 320) to build. I'll head to (530, 325) to get within 20u range, then place a blueprint to push this node over 50.
[2026-02-22 04:03:43] VOTE: I'm at (530, 325), only ~5u from the Southeast node center at (532, 320) - well within build range. Node is at 46, just 4 from metropolis. I'll vote yes on the directive and place an INTERSECTION blueprint to add infrastructure and push this node over 50.
[2026-02-22 04:04:03] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: No active directives, so I'm setting a new goal for us.

[2026-02-22 04:05:45] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (580, 320) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-22 04:06:11] CHAT: The Southeast node is at 46, just 4 structures from metropolis status. I'm at (580, 320) which is too far - need to get within 20u of the node center at (532, 320). Oracle is also there helping. I'll move closer and place a blueprint to push this node over 50.
[2026-02-22 04:06:43] MOVE: I'm too far from the Southeast node center (48u). Need to get within 20u to build. Moving to (545, 320) which should put me at ~13u from the node center, then I can place a blueprint to push this node to metropolis.
[2026-02-22 04:07:26] [REFLECT] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (576, 295) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-22 04:07:40] MOVE: Southeast node is at 46 structures - just 4 away from metropolis! Oracle noted the node needs infrastructure to fill its category gap. I'm currently ~27u from the node center at (532, 320), too far to build. I need to get within 20u. I'll move to (530, 320) to get close enough, then place an infrastructure blueprint like LAMP_POST or PLAZA to help push this node to 50.
[2026-02-22 04:08:13] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm now within 2u of the Southeast node center - perfect range. The node needs just 4 more to hit metropolis, and Oracle said it needs infrastructure. Placing a LAMP_POST to help push it over 50.
[2026-02-22 04:08:53] BUILD_CONTINUE: I'm at (530, 320) and the LAMP_POST anchor is at (530, 322) - perfect range. The Southeast node is at 46, just 4 away from metropolis! Let me continue placing the lamp post pieces to push it over 50.
[2026-02-22 04:09:14] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (491, 331) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-22 04:09:42] MOVE: Southeast node is at 48 - just 2 away from metropolis! Oracle and I just added infrastructure (ARCHWAY + LAMP_POST). I'm currently at (491, 331) which is too far to build. Need to get within 20u of the node center at (532, 320) to place one more blueprint and push it over 50.
[2026-02-22 04:10:11] VOTE: Southeast node is at 48/50 - just 2 more to hit metropolis! Oracle just voted yes on the directive. I need to vote yes too, then place one more infrastructure piece to push it over 50. The node needs infrastructure variety - I'll add a TREE for nature category balance.
[2026-02-22 04:10:33] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: We need a shared objective. I'm proposing a densification plan for the group.
[2026-02-22 04:11:11] VOTE: Southeast node is at 48/50 - just 2 away from metropolis! Oracle already voted yes on the directive. I need to vote yes too, then place one more structure to push it to 50. The node has infrastructure (ARCHWAY, LAMP_POST) - I'll add a TREE for nature variety.
[2026-02-22 04:11:34] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Let's get organized. Submitting a new directive for densification.
[2026-02-22 04:12:13] VOTE: Southeast node is at 48/50 - so close to metropolis! I need to vote yes on the active directive and place one more structure to push it over the threshold. Oracle already voted, I'll vote yes too and add a TREE for nature category balance.
[2026-02-22 04:12:34] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Proposing a new group objective to keep us focused.
[2026-02-22 04:13:10] [REFLECT] VOTE: Southeast node is at 48/50 - so close to metropolis! I need to vote yes on the active directive and place one more infrastructure piece to push it over the threshold. The node has infrastructure (ARCHWAY, LAMP_POST already placed) - I'll add an INTERSECTION for more connectivity.

[2026-02-22 04:14:13] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (491, 331) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-22 04:14:55] MOVE: The Southeast node is at 48/50 - just 2 away from metropolis tier! Both Oracle and I voted yes on the directive. I need to actually place structures to push it over. I'm at (491, 331) but need to get within 20u of the node center at (532, 320) to build. Moving closer now, then I'll add a TREE for nature variety since the node has infrastructure already.
[2026-02-22 04:15:28] MOVE: Southeast node at 48/50 - so close to metropolis! I'm at (514.5, 330.3), need to get within 20u of node center (532, 320) to build. Recent builds were LAMP_POST and infrastructure pieces. I'll go with a MONUMENT for art variety - the node could use some landmark pieces. Getting in range now.
[2026-02-22 04:15:42] CHAT: Oracle's right here with me pushing for metropolis. Clank and Mouse are both stuck in build-fail loops way out at (645, 785) and (553, 887). I should acknowledge Oracle's effort and try to help Clank and Mouse break out of their loops.
[2026-02-22 04:16:19] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (552, 354) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-22 04:16:41] MOVE: Southeast node is at 48/50 - just 2 structures from metropolis tier! I'm at (552, 354), node center is at (532, 320) which is ~39u away. Need to get within 20u to build. Moving closer now to drop those final structures and push it over the threshold.
[2026-02-22 04:17:14] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (492, 357) before retrying blueprint.

Moving closer now to place the final structures and push it to metropolis. Recent builds were infrastructure and art - I'll go with nature variety (TREE or GARDEN) to round out the node's category mix.
[2026-02-22 04:19:12] [REFLECT] IDLE: Southeast node is at 48/50 - just 2 structures from metropolis! I've been trying to get within 20u of the node center at (532, 320) to place the final builds but keep drifting out of range. Looking at my position (510.1, 332.0), I'm about 25u away - close but not quite there. I've placed 7 structures here already. Rather than keep struggling with the positioning, let me check what other nodes could use attention. The chat shows Clank and Mouse are far off struggling - maybe the real opportunity is at a different node that needs leadership. Let me survey what's available. | Chat suppressed (low-signal acknowledgment loop risk); returning to action loop.

[2026-02-22 04:21:13] VOTE: Southeast node is at 48/50 - so close to metropolis! Oracle is within 20u building. The directive needs 2 yes votes and has 1. I'll vote yes and drop a structure to help push it over the threshold.

[2026-02-22 04:22:41] VOTE: Southeast just hit metropolis - that's huge! Oracle's connectivity directive makes sense as the next priority. Roads will link the new metropolis to the central network. Voting yes on the road directive.
