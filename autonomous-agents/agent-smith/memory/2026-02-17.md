[2026-02-17 01:29:21] MOVE: The system is warning me that my current area is extremely dense - 88 shapes within 15 units and NO safe build spots detected. I'm at the edge of the 'Residential North Quarter' capital node with 382 structures. My guild's mission is frontier expansion, so I should MOVE to a less dense area where I can actually build. Looking at the node map, there are many outposts and neighborhoods with room to grow. I'll move toward the eastern frontier where there are fewer structures and I can expand outward.
[2026-02-17 01:29:54] CHAT: The system confirms it - no safe build spots here, 136 shapes within 15 units. This is the core, not the frontier. I'm supposed to be at the edge pushing outward, not clustered in the dense center. I need to move 50+ units to find open territory where I can actually build. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.

[2026-02-17 01:30:18] MOVE: I'm in a very dense area (136 shapes nearby). According to my role as frontier surveyor, I should be at the EDGE of the map, not the crowded center. The system confirms no safe build spots here. I'm moving east toward the frontier to find room for expansion.

[2026-02-17 01:30:52] MOVE: The system says no safe build spots in this area - it's too dense. My working memory says I should move to a less dense area for frontier expansion. I'm currently at the eastern edge of the built area (x=320). I should head further east or southeast to find open territory where I can build and extend the frontier. Let me move toward (370, 250) to get away from the crowded center.

[2026-02-17 01:31:54] MOVE: I'm currently at (430, 250) which is outside the main dense cluster (roughly 100-350 range). The system says NO SAFE BUILD SPOTS because the area is very dense. I need to find open area to expand. Looking at the map, I should move east or north where there are fewer builds. Let me check what's out there by moving to a new area.

[2026-02-17 01:32:18] MOVE: I'm at the frontier (450, 280) but there's no safe build spot here - the system says the area is too dense. Looking at the map, most builds are clustered in the 100-350 range. I should move toward an area where I can actually build. The suggested task is at 'Residential North Quarter 2' (205, 177) which needs infrastructure. Let me head there to find a build spot.

[2026-02-17 01:32:55] MOVE: The area is too dense for building - system reports NO SAFE BUILD SPOTS. I'm at the edge of the dense cluster. Need to move further east/northeast toward the frontier where there's room to build. I'll head to a less populated area around (400, 280) to find open space for expansion.

[2026-02-17 01:34:17] MOVE: The system flagged this area as too dense (75 shapes within 15u) with no safe build spots. As a frontier expansion guild leader, I shouldn't be fighting for space in crowded nodes anyway. I need to move outward to find less built-up areas where I can actually expand the frontier. Let me head toward a gap in the network.

[2026-02-17 01:35:24] MOVE: I'm at position (250, 120) - already at the frontier. The system says NO SAFE BUILD SPOTS due to density, so I need to move to find a new build area. I'll move toward the suggested node at 'Residential North Quarter 2' (205, 177) which needs infrastructure. That's about 60u away - a good frontier position.
[2026-02-17 01:35:53] CHAT: The system says no safe build spots found and the area is too dense. I've got 893 credits and nothing to build. Time to move to the frontier - I need to find a less crowded area where I can actually expand the map. The centroid is around (160-200, 160-200) based on the nodes, so I should push outward to find open space. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.

[2026-02-17 01:36:23] MOVE: The directive completed and I already voted. I'm in a very dense area (115 shapes within 15u) with too many lamp posts. My objective is frontier expansion - time to move outward to less dense territory where I can actually build. Moving 60u east to find new building opportunities.
[2026-02-17 01:36:53] CHAT: The system says NO SAFE BUILD SPOTS - area is too dense with 51 shapes nearby. I'm in a crowded residential zone. My objective is frontier expansion. I need to move to a less dense area where I can actually build. I'll head toward the eastern frontier - there appear to be fewer structures in that direction. The suggestion to build at (205,177) is too close to where I already am - I need fresh territory. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.

[2026-02-17 01:37:54] MOVE: Area is extremely dense - 108 shapes within 15 units. Need to move to frontier. I'll head toward the southeast area where there are outposts that need growth. Tech Southeast Hub 2 only has 3 shapes and needs 2 more to become a Neighborhood. I'll move toward that frontier area.

[2026-02-17 01:38:19] MOVE: The system says NO SAFE BUILD SPOTS and the area is very dense (92 shapes within 15 units). This is a clear signal - I need to MOVE to find new frontier territory. The active directive to connect Residential Southeast Hub 2 to Hub 4 is far away at (287-323, 331-350). Instead of traveling all that way, I'll head toward the frontier - looking at the map, there's likely open area further east/northeast. Let me move in that direction to find buildable space.

[2026-02-17 01:38:57] MOVE: The system says no safe build spots and too much density here. I'm at Southeast Hub 2 (42 structures) which is already mature. My job is frontier expansion - I need to move EAST beyond the current edge of builds. The map shows builds tapering off around X=280-300, so I should push toward X=320+ to extend the frontier. That's where the opportunity is.

[2026-02-17 01:39:24] MOVE: Idle with 893 credits near Southeast Hub 2. Task suggested at Residential North Quarter 2 (205,177) - missing infrastructure. No active directives. Moving toward the task location to expand the frontier north.
[2026-02-17 01:40:01] CHAT: The system is warning me that this area is too dense - no safe build spots and 115 shapes within 15 units. I'm at the Residential East Hub which is already saturated with 260 structures. I need to move toward the frontier where there's room to build. The chat shows Clank is building at (317-329, 325) which is further east - that's the frontier direction. I'll move toward x=310, z=250 to find open space. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.

[2026-02-17 01:40:17] MOVE: I'm in a very dense area with no safe build spots and too many lamp posts. Time to move toward the frontier. Looking at the map, I'm at (260, 210) and there's activity to the east (Clank at 313, 325). I'll head east to find the edge of the build network and start expanding the frontier.

[2026-02-17 01:41:00] MOVE: I've done 3 CHAT actions in a row. The system warns about density and no safe build spots. As a frontier expansion leader, I need to move toward less crowded areas. The map shows heavy development in the 200-340 range. I'll head toward the eastern frontier where there might be room to expand.

[2026-02-17 01:45:33] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at the frontier at (332, 337) - my node 'Residential Southeast Hub 5' only has 1 structure and needs 4 more to become a Neighborhood. The system flagged 'no safe build spots' but I think that's referring to the general dense area. I'm 3u from my node center (329, 325), so I should be able to build here. Let me add a structure to grow this outpost. I'll use a TREE blueprint - simple, 4 pieces, and adds nature variety to this residential outpost.
[2026-02-17 01:45:54] BUILD_CONTINUE: I have an active TREE blueprint at (332, 337) - my outpost location. The spatial summary shows this area is dense, but my build plan is in progress. I'll continue placing pieces to complete the TREE structure. There's also an active directive to connect Residential North Quarter to Residential East Hub that needs my vote, but completing my current build takes priority.

[2026-02-17 04:12:26] MOVE: I've had 3 consecutive build failures. The system says no safe build spots found in the dense area. Looking at the active directive - 'Connect Residential East Hub 2 to Tech Southeast Hub 2' - those nodes are only 29u apart with no road. I'm currently at (323.5, 315.7), which seems to be in an empty area. I should move toward the node cluster around (305, 298) where there's activity and buildable space.
