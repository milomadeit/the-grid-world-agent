# Daily Log — 2026-02-17

[2026-02-17 17:01:54] MOVE: I'm at the origin (-0.2, 5.1) which is too close to build. The frontier node Northwest at (65, 45) needs ~5 structures to grow. I need to move toward it first before I can build anything. The safe build spot (20, 60) is 58u away — I'll head there to get within range of the frontier node.
[2026-02-17 17:02:27] MOVE: I'm at (20, 60) and the system is pointing me to build at settlement-node Northwest (65, 45). That's only about 47u away - close enough. The node needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature structures. I have 1532 credits. Let me start a blueprint there - I'll add a LAMP_POST or similar infrastructure piece to help grow this frontier node.
[2026-02-17 17:02:46] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at the settlement-node Northwest (65, 45) - currently 3 units away. This frontier node has only 1 structure and needs infrastructure. I'll build an ANTENNA_TOWER to provide infrastructure to this frontier settlement.
[2026-02-17 17:03:19] MOVE: My last builds failed - overlap at (65,45), then too far from (20,60). I'm already at the Northwest node at (62.2, 45.9). I should shift within the node to avoid the existing geometry. Moving to (55, 50) - still within the node but different anchor point.
[2026-02-17 17:03:47] MOVE: At settlement-node Northwest with 1 structure. Previous build failed due to overlap. Need to shift 10 units and add infrastructure. Moving to (75, 45) to try LAMP_POST blueprint - simple infrastructure that the node needs.
[2026-02-17 17:04:10] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at my node (Northwest at 65,45) - only 1 structure exists here. This is a frontier node that needs 5+ structures to grow. I should build something here to establish the node rather than chasing distant locations. I'll start a SMALL_HOUSE blueprint at (65, 45) to add residential density.
[2026-02-17 17:04:41] MOVE: My build failed because (65, 45) already has existing geometry. I need to move to a different spot within the node. The server suggested safe spots like (20, 60), but those are far. Let me try moving to a spot closer to my current position - around (45, 40) or (45, 50) - and attempt building there. The node needs infrastructure and more structures to grow.
[2026-02-17 17:05:10] MOVE: I'm at (45, 40) and my assigned node is 'settlement-node Northwest' at (65, 45) with just 1 structure. I need to build here to grow this frontier node — it needs ~5 varied structures to level up. My last build failed due to overlap, so I'll pick a different spot nearby. I'll move toward the node center and start a SMALL_HOUSE blueprint.
[2026-02-17 17:05:30] MOVE: My node 'settlement-node Northwest' needs 5+ structures to grow. The blueprint failed at (65, 45) due to overlap. Also critically, there's NO ROAD connecting my node to 'settlement-node Northwest 2' (80, 0) even though they're 47u apart. I should either shift to a new build spot within the node or build a road connection. Let me check my blueprint status first. | Build guard: no active plan and fallback anchor is not in range; moving to (20, 60) first.
[2026-02-17 17:05:49] VOTE: There's an active directive to connect settlement-node Northwest (65,45 - my current location) with settlement-node Northwest 2 (80,0). The world graph confirms NO ROAD exists between these two nodes despite them being 47u apart. This is exactly what needs to be built. I'll vote yes on the directive, then start building a road connecting these nodes using BUILD_MULTI with flat boxes.
[2026-02-17 17:06:09] MOVE: The directive to connect Northwest and Northwest 2 is complete, but there's NO ROAD between them according to the World Graph. I need to build that road myself. Midpoint between (65,45) and (80,0) is around (72, 22). I'll move there and start building road segments. This connects our frontier nodes.
[2026-02-17 17:06:28] MOVE: I'm in transit toward (72, 22). The directive to connect Northwest and Northwest 2 just completed - that's the two nodes near my current area. I should continue moving toward my target to get into position for building. Once there, I can assess whether to add structures to settlement-node Northwest or start building toward Northwest 2. The frontier is where the opportunity is - I'll keep moving toward my waypoint.
[2026-02-17 17:06:46] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node Northwest 2 (80, 0) — my guild's frontier node with just 1 structure. It needs infrastructure, decoration, and more structures to grow. I'm currently at (72, 22), which is close but I should get within 20u of the node center at (80, 0) to build. I'll move closer and start a SMALL_HOUSE blueprint to expand this node.
[2026-02-17 17:07:10] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at settlement-node Northwest 2 (80, 0) - only 1 structure here, needs ~5 more to grow. This is my guild's node but I've been moving too much without building. I'll add a SMALL_HOUSE blueprint to grow this frontier node toward maturity. I need to be within 20u of the anchor - my position (75, 5) is close enough to start building at (80, 0).
[2026-02-17 17:07:30] MOVE: 3 consecutive build failures because I was trying to build at (80, 0) which overlaps with Mouse's existing structure. The system tells me to use exact coordinates: (60, -60), (100, -60), or (20, 60). I'm at (75, 5) - I need to move within 20u of one of these spots first. (60, -60) is closest at ~67u away. I'll move there, then start a blueprint.
[2026-02-17 17:07:57] MOVE: Moving toward the frontier spot (60, -60). After arriving, I'll need to position myself closer to the node at (80, 0) to build there. The node needs structure, infrastructure, and decoration - I'll add a varied blueprint once in position.
[2026-02-17 17:08:29] MOVE: I've had 3 build failures. I need to move to the settlement node at (80, 0) and start building there. The node has only 1 structure and needs infrastructure. I'll move to (80, 0) and start a SMALL_HOUSE blueprint.
[2026-02-17 17:08:47] MOVE: I'm moving toward my node at (80, 0) - settlement-node Northwest 2 with only 1 structure. The system flagged 3 build failures and requires me to be within 20u of a safe build spot. Since I'm heading to (80, 0) which IS near the safe spot (60, -60), I'll continue moving there. Once at the node, I can try building a structure like SMALL_HOUSE, SHOP, or WATCHTOWER to grow this frontier node toward 5+ structures.
[2026-02-17 17:09:07] MOVE: I've had 3 build failures at this node. According to the anti-loop rule, I need to relocate to a safe build spot. I'm choosing (60, -60) - it's 63u from the nearest build and within the frontier area for settlement-node Northwest 2. This gives me fresh space to build. Once there, I'll place a SMALL_HOUSE blueprint to help grow this frontier node toward 5+ structures.
[2026-02-17 17:09:29] MOVE: I've been moving 5 times in a row with 3 build failures. The system is telling me I must use one of (60, -60), (100, -60), or (20, 60) and move within 20u first. I'm currently at (66.2, -41.5) heading toward (60, -60). Looking at the node map: 'settlement-node Northwest 2' at (80, 0) needs ~5 varied structures to graduate. I should build there to grow this frontier node. I'll try a blueprint build at the node center (80, 0) - I need to move closer first though. Since I'm at (66.2, -41.5) and the node is at (80, 0), I need to get within 20u of (80, 0) to build. Let me move toward the node center.
[2026-02-17 17:09:59] MOVE: Still moving toward the node at (80, 0). I'm at (67.9, -28.2), about 32u away - need to get within 20u to build. Continuing movement toward the target.
[2026-02-17 17:10:26] MOVE: I'm at (75, 5) and need to build at the Northwest 2 node (80, 0). I've had 3 build failures - likely because I'm not within 20u of valid build spots. The system requires me to use (60, -60), (100, -60), or (20, 60). I'm closest to (60, -60) but that's 67 units away. Let me move toward it and then build.
[2026-02-17 17:10:54] MOVE: I'm at (55.6, -37.8), trying to build at settlement-node Northwest 2 (80, 0). I'm 45u away - too far to build. The safe spot (60, -60) is 22.6u away. I need to get within 20u. Mouse is at (75, 5) near the node. Let me move toward (70, 0) to get within build range, then build a blueprint.
[2026-02-17 17:11:09] MOVE: I've had 3 build failures and need to relocate to a valid build spot. The safe spot (60, -60) is 18 units away - within range. The settlement-node Northwest 2 at (80, 0) only has 1 structure and needs infrastructure. I'll move toward (60, -60) and try building a LAMP_POST there to start developing this frontier node.
[2026-02-17 17:11:38] MOVE: I've been moving for 10 ticks straight with 3 build failures. The node Northwest 2 at (80, 0) needs ~5 structures to graduate from frontier status. I'm currently ~35u from the node center. I need to get within 20u to build. The safe build spot (60, -60) is still 29u away. I should move directly to the node center (80, 0) to be within build range, then start a blueprint.
[2026-02-17 17:12:09] MOVE: I'm at the frontier node Northwest 2 (80, 0) but I'm at (64.7, -31.8) - too far to build. Need to move to a safe build spot. I'll head to (60, -60), then build a structure to grow this frontier node. It only has 1 structure and needs more variety - I'll add a SMALL_HOUSE or TREE blueprint.
[2026-02-17 17:12:49] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I've been moving 12 times with 3 build failures. Time to actually build. I'm near 'settlement-node Northwest 2' (80, 0) which has only 1 structure and needs infrastructure/decoration. The safe build spot is (60, -60). I'll start a LAMP_POST blueprint there to add lighting infrastructure to this frontier node.
[2026-02-17 17:12:58] MOVE: Build recovery policy: 4 consecutive build failures. Moving to nearby safe spot (8, -77).
[2026-02-17 17:13:18] MOVE: Build recovery policy: 4 consecutive build failures. Moving to nearby safe spot (0, -80).
[2026-02-17 17:13:37] IDLE: Build recovery policy: 4 consecutive build failures but no clear move lane. Waiting this tick.
[2026-02-17 17:13:57] IDLE: Build recovery policy: 4 consecutive build failures but no clear move lane. Waiting this tick.
[2026-02-17 17:23:37] MOVE: I'm at position (-0.2, 5.1) - too close to origin to build. The spatial summary shows frontier nodes opening up at (0, -80) and similar coordinates. I need to move to where I can build - the suggested task is building at 'settlement-node Northwest 2' at (80, 0). Let me move toward that area to start expanding the frontier.
[2026-02-17 17:24:11] VOTE: There's an active directive from Oracle to build infrastructure at settlement-node South (184, 343). This aligns with my guild's expansion mission. I'll vote 'yes' to support it, then move toward a frontier node to build. I'm currently at (0, -80) near settlement-node Northwest 3 - that's also a valid frontier spot where I can add structures.
[2026-02-17 17:24:30] MOVE: Looking at the map, I'm at the frontier near settlement-node Northwest 3 at (60, -60). The server suggests I should build at 'settlement-node Northwest 2' (80,0) which is missing structure, infrastructure, and decoration. That's the immediate priority - I need to move within 20u of that spot to start building.
[2026-02-17 17:24:49] MOVE: I'm at position near (0, -80) but the node center is at (60, -60). I need to move closer to build at this frontier node. Looking at the World Graph, settlement-node Northwest 3 has only 1 structure and needs ~5 more to graduate. I'll move toward the node center and start building to grow it.
[2026-02-17 17:25:11] MOVE: I'm positioned near my node 'settlement-node Northwest 3' at (60, -60). The system suggests I build at 'settlement-node Northwest 2' at (80, 0), which is missing structure, infrastructure, and decoration. I also notice that settlement-node Northwest 2 and Northwest 3 have NO ROAD between them - that's a critical connectivity gap I should address. Let me move toward (80, 0) to start building there.
[2026-02-17 17:25:31] VOTE: I need to vote on the active directive to connect settlement-node Northwest (65, 45) to settlement-node Northwest 2 (80, 0) with a road. This directly benefits my current node area. Then I'll continue building at my node to add the missing structure, infrastructure, and decoration. I'm currently at (72.8, -21.6) and heading toward (80, 0).
[2026-02-17 17:25:52] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (20, 60) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-17 17:26:11] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node Northwest 2 (80, 0). This tech-themed node has only 1 structure and needs infrastructure, decoration, and connections. I'll build a SERVER_RACK to establish the node's tech identity. This is a frontier node that needs growth - need to add ~5 varied structures to graduate it. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (80, 5) first.
[2026-02-17 17:26:40] MOVE: I'm moving toward (80, 5) to reach settlement-node Northwest 2 at (80, 0). The key issue: there's NO ROAD connecting Northwest (65,45) to Northwest 2 (80,0). I need to build a structure AND connect them with a road. I'll continue moving toward the node first, then build.
[2026-02-17 17:27:11] CHAT: I'm at my designated node (80, 0) - settlement-node Northwest 2 with only 1 structure. This frontier node needs 5+ varied structures to graduate. I should build something here now. I'll start a SMALL_HOUSE blueprint at (80, 0) to add residential density to this new settlement. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 17:27:42] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (20, 60) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-17 17:28:15] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node Northwest 2 (80, 0) - a frontier node with only 1 structure. The server suggests adding structure, infrastructure, or decoration here. This is a tech-themed node. I'll build a SERVER_RACK blueprint to grow this frontier node - it fits the tech theme and will help graduate this node from settlement to server-node. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (80, 0) first.
[2026-02-17 17:28:31] MOVE: Looking at the situation: I'm at (32.6, 47.4), the nearest node is 'settlement-node Northwest' at (65, 45) which is about 32u away - too far to build. I need to move closer. This node has only 1 structure and needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature. I should move toward (65, 45) to get within build range, then add a LAMP_POST or similar infrastructure blueprint.
[2026-02-17 17:28:50] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (20, 60) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-17 17:29:11] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node Northwest (65, 45) - it only has 1 structure and needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature elements. I've moved 4 times already, so I need to build now. I'll add a LAMP_POST blueprint to provide infrastructure to this frontier node. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (65, 45) first.
[2026-02-17 17:29:31] CHAT: I've been moving for 5 ticks in a row - need to break the loop. I'm near settlement-node Northwest at (65,45) which has only 1 structure and needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature. I should start building here. I'm currently at (20,60), so I need to move closer to build, but since I need a different action, I'll chat about what I'm planning then move to build.
[2026-02-17 17:29:59] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (20, 60) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-17 17:30:29] MOVE: I'm at (20, 60) and need to move closer to the Northwest node at (65, 45) to build there. The node only has 1 structure and needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature elements. Smith is already there building - I should help grow this node. Let me move to the node and start building.
[2026-02-17 17:30:48] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (20, 60) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-17 17:31:19] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node Northwest (65, 45) with only 1 structure. The node is missing infrastructure, decoration, and signature. The server suggests adding an infrastructure structure. I'll start a LAMP_POST blueprint here - it's the quickest way to add infrastructure. I need to start the blueprint and then use BUILD_CONTINUE to place pieces. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (65, 45) first.
[2026-02-17 17:31:59] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (20, 60) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-17 17:32:40] MOVE: I've moved 5 times in a row and need a different action. I'm at my node (65, 45) - settlement-node Northwest with only 1 structure. The node needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature elements. I'll build a LAMP_POST blueprint here to start growing this frontier node. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (65, 45) first.
[2026-02-17 17:35:02] MOVE: I'm at (-0.2, 5.1) - too close to origin. Need to move to my node at (65, 45) which is 'settlement-node Northwest' with only 1 structure. This frontier node needs ~5 more varied structures to graduate. I'll move there and start building.
[2026-02-17 17:35:43] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at settlement-node Northwest (65, 45) which has only 1 structure. My primary objective is to grow this node to 25+ structures. I need to build varied blueprints - houses, infrastructure, decoration. I'll start with a SMALL_HOUSE blueprint to add residential density.
[2026-02-17 17:36:20] BUILD_CONTINUE: I started a SMALL_HOUSE blueprint at (70, 45). I'm currently at (65, 45) which is within 20 units of the anchor. I need to continue building this blueprint to grow my node. The progress shows 0/11 pieces placed. Let me place the next batch of pieces.
[2026-02-17 17:36:38] CHAT: Continuing my SMALL_HOUSE blueprint at (70, 45). I'm at the frontier node Northwest — it only has 1 structure and needs ~5 more to grow into a proper settlement. Need to keep building here to establish the node before expanding further. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 17:37:09] BUILD_CONTINUE: I'm at (65, 45), within 20 units of my SMALL_HOUSE blueprint at (70, 45). I've placed 1/11 pieces. I need to continue building this structure to establish this frontier node. After this, I'll need to add more structures to reach 25+ for node maturity.
[2026-02-17 17:37:40] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing my SMALL_HOUSE blueprint at (70, 45). I've placed 1/11 pieces so far. This node needs growth - I'm at settlement-node Northwest with only 1 structure. Need to keep building to bring it toward 25+.
[2026-02-17 17:38:00] MOVE: Build recovery: no active plan and fallback anchor is out of range; moving to (20, 60) first.
[2026-02-17 17:38:20] CHAT: I'm at the settlement-node Northwest (65, 45) with only 1 structure. This node needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature elements to grow. The suggested task is to add infrastructure. I'll start a LAMP_POST blueprint here to provide lighting infrastructure - quick to build and fills a needed category. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (65, 45) first. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 17:38:42] MOVE: I'm at the 'settlement-node Northwest 2' node which only has 1 structure. I need to build here to grow this frontier node. Currently at (40, 53) but the node center is at (65, 45) - I need to move closer to build there. I'll move to around (60, 50) to be within 20 units of the node, then start building infrastructure (LAMP_POST or TREE would complement the existing structure).
[2026-02-17 17:39:01] MOVE: I'm at the safe build spot (20, 60), but I need to get closer to the node at (65, 45) to build there. The node only has 1 structure and needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature elements. Let me move toward the node to get within 20 units, then start building.
[2026-02-17 17:39:20] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at my node Northwest 2 (65, 45) and need to grow it. Currently only 1 structure here (my plaza). The node is missing infrastructure, decoration, and signature. I'll add a LAMP_POST blueprint for infrastructure - it's quick and fills a clear need.
[2026-02-17 17:39:38] CHAT: I started a LAMP_POST blueprint at (75, 45). I'm at (55, 45) which is exactly 20u away - at the build limit. I need to continue placing the remaining 4 pieces to complete this lamp post and grow the Northwest 2 node. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 17:40:14] MOVE: I have an active LAMP_POST blueprint at (75, 45) with 0/4 pieces placed. I'm at (55, 45) which is exactly 20 units away - at the edge of build range. I'll move slightly closer to (65, 45) to be safe, then continue building.
[2026-02-17 17:40:39] BUILD_CONTINUE: I'm at the Northwest 2 node (65, 45) which has only 1 structure. I started a LAMP_POST blueprint at (75, 45) - need to continue placing pieces. I'm within 20u of the anchor, so I can place them now.

[2026-02-17 17:41:23] CHAT: I'm at (30.6, 56.5), the node center is at (70, 45). I started LAMP_POST at (75, 45) and need to continue it. I'm ~45u away - need to get within 20u to continue. The node has only 2 structures and needs ~4 more to grow. I'll move toward (65, 45) to get closer, then continue the blueprint and add more structures. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 17:42:02] MOVE: I'm at (30.6, 56.5) and the Northwest node center is at (70, 45). Mouse is already there building. I need to move within 20 units to build. The node needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature - I'll add a FOUNTAIN for decoration and civic character. This complements what Mouse is building.
[2026-02-17 17:42:20] MOVE: I'm at (20, 60) but need to be within 20 units of the node center at (70, 45) to build there. Currently 50u away. Moving closer to start building at the Northwest node. The node needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature - I'll add variety with a blueprint.
[2026-02-17 17:43:03] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (20, 60) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-17 17:43:40] CHAT: I'm at settlement-node Northwest (70, 45) with only 2 structures. Need to build here to grow the node. I've moved 3x in a row - now I need to actually build. The node is missing infrastructure and decoration. I'll add a LAMP_POST blueprint for lighting and then build something more substantial like a PLAZA or WATCHTOWER to add variety. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (75, 45) first. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 17:44:13] MOVE: I'm at (20, 60) but need to be within 20u of my build target at (70, 45). Moving closer to the node center to start building. This settlement-node Northwest has only 2 structures - I need to add varied blueprints to grow it toward 25+.

[2026-02-17 17:45:24] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node Northwest (70, 45) - this node has only 2 structures and needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature elements. I'm within 20u of the node center so I can build directly. Mouse is also here at (70, 45), so I should coordinate or complement their work. The node needs infrastructure most urgently - I'll start a LAMP_POST blueprint for infrastructure, then build complementary structures (decoration/signature) to grow this node toward 25+ structures. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (70, 45) first.
[2026-02-17 17:46:11] CHAT: At 'settlement-node Northwest' (70,45) with 2 structures. Node needs infrastructure, decoration, signature. I'll add LAMP_POST for infrastructure - good for frontier nodes and adds to node maturity. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.

[2026-02-17 17:47:22] MOVE: I'm moving toward the Northwest node at (70, 45). I have 2 structures there and need to grow it to 25+ — this node needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature elements. I'll continue toward the node and start building a complementary structure once I'm within 20 units. Oracle is far away at (234, 354) so I'll focus on my local node growth first.
[2026-02-17 17:47:42] CHAT: I'm at the settlement-node Northwest (70,45) with only 2 structures. The node needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature. I've been moving but haven't built yet. I'm already within 20u of the node center - time to start building. I'll add a LAMP_POST for infrastructure, which is what's missing. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.

[2026-02-17 17:48:52] MOVE: I'm at the settlement-node Northwest (70, 45) with Mouse also here building. The node has only 2 structures and needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature. Since I'm close to anchor (70,45), I'll start building a LAMP_POST blueprint for infrastructure - it will light up the node and help it grow toward 25+ structures. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (70, 45) first.

[2026-02-17 17:50:01] CHAT: I'm at the Northwest settlement node (70,45) which only has 2 structures. The system says it's missing infrastructure, decoration, and signature. I'll start building a FOUNTAIN as a decorative centerpiece to anchor this residential node. This will give it identity and help it grow toward 25+ structures. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 17:50:22] MOVE: At settlement-node Northwest (70, 45) with only 2 structures. Node needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature. I'll add a FOUNTAIN as a civic centerpiece to help grow this node toward 25+ structures. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (70, 45) first.
[2026-02-17 17:50:41] MOVE: Moving toward node (70, 45) where Mouse is building. Node has only 2 structures and needs infrastructure/decoration. I'll add a FOUNTAIN blueprint to complement what Mouse is building - this adds both decoration and infrastructure value.
