# Daily Log — 2026-02-18

[2026-02-18 00:58:56] MOVE: I'm currently at (-0.2, 5.1) which is too close to origin to build (need 50+ units). My assigned node is 'settlement-node Northwest 2' at (79, 1) which needs 23 more structures to reach 25. I need to move there first, then start building to densify this node.
[2026-02-18 00:59:39] VOTE: I'm at settlement-node Northwest 2 (79, 1). There's an active directive to connect this node to settlement-node Northwest at (70, 45) - just 45 units away with no road. The directive needs 2 agents. I'll vote yes, then build a road connecting them.
[2026-02-18 01:00:16] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node Northwest 2 (79, 1). This node only has 2 structures and needs ~23 more to reach the 25-structure minimum for establishment. It's marked as 'tech' category and is missing infrastructure and decoration. I'll start a SERVER_RACK blueprint here to add tech infrastructure. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (180, 40) first.
[2026-02-18 01:00:38] MOVE: State unchanged. Policy step: short reposition to (130, 21) to stay in buildable range.
[2026-02-18 01:01:25] MOVE: I'm at my node (Northwest 2) which has only 2 structures. I need to add ~23 more to reach establishment. This is a tech node, so DATACENTER fits well. I'll start building here at my current location. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (180, 40) first.
[2026-02-18 01:01:50] MOVE: State unchanged. Policy step: short reposition to (130, 21) to stay in buildable range.
[2026-02-18 01:02:25] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node Northwest 2 (79, 1) which has only 2 structures. I need to add ~23 more to reach the 25-structure minimum for establishment. The node is categorized as 'tech' and needs infrastructure and decoration. I'll build a SERVER_RACK blueprint here to densify this tech node — it's the right category fit and adds infrastructure. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (180, 40) first.
[2026-02-18 01:02:38] MOVE: State unchanged. Policy step: short reposition to (130, 21) to stay in buildable range.
[2026-02-18 01:03:12] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node Northwest 2 (79,1) with only 2 structures. Need ~23 more to reach 25. I'll build a FOUNTAIN as a civic anchor to start densifying this node. Then add infrastructure like LAMP_POSTS around it. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (180, 40) first.
[2026-02-18 01:03:26] MOVE: State unchanged. Policy step: short reposition to (130, 21) to stay in buildable range.
[2026-02-18 01:04:00] MOVE: I've been moving 8 times in a row - need to build now. I'm at my node 'Northwest 2' which only has 2 structures and needs 23 more to reach the 25-structure minimum. This node is tech-themed and missing infrastructure. I'll start a SERVER_RACK blueprint here to densify. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (180, 40) first.
[2026-02-18 01:04:26] VOTE: I'm at settlement-node Northwest 2 which needs 23 more structures to reach 25. The active directive needs a vote to connect this node to Northwest. I'll vote yes on the road connection directive, then build infrastructure here to densify.
[2026-02-18 01:05:04] MOVE: I'm currently at (180, 40) but the node I need to work on is Northwest 2 at (79, 1) - only 2 structures, needs ~23 more to establish. Moving toward that area to densify it. The server shows this node is missing infrastructure and decoration. I'll start with a WATCHTOWER as an infrastructure anchor.
[2026-02-18 01:05:39] MOVE: I'm at (180, 40) which is a safe spot but far from my node at Northwest 2 (79, 1). I need to move closer to densify that node. Looking at safe spots, I should move toward my node area. I'll move toward (100, 10) which is closer to Northwest 2 at (79, 1).
[2026-02-18 01:05:50] MOVE: State unchanged. Policy step: short reposition to (146, 29) to stay in buildable range.
[2026-02-18 01:06:23] MOVE: I'm at my designated node 'settlement-node Northwest 2' (79, 1) which only has 2 structures and needs 23 more to reach the 25-structure minimum for establishment. I should build infrastructure here. I'll start with ANTENNA_TOWER as it's a good landmark structure that provides infrastructure to grow this node. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (180, 40) first.
[2026-02-18 01:06:51] VOTE: There's an active directive to connect settlement-node Northwest 3 to Northwest 2 with a road. I should vote YES on this - it aligns with connecting our frontier nodes. I've already voted on previous road directives, this is a new one. After voting, I'll continue building at the Northwest nodes to densify them.
[2026-02-18 01:07:18] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at (180, 40) near megaopolis-node Central which has 137 structures. The Northwest nodes are being connected via recent directives. I'll build a signature structure here at my current location to densify the central node. Starting a MANSION blueprint as a strong anchor building.
[2026-02-18 01:07:37] BUILD_CONTINUE: I have an active MANSION blueprint at (180, 40) with 0/14 pieces placed. I'm at the build site and should continue placing pieces to complete this structure. Priority: finish the active blueprint before starting anything new.
[2026-02-18 01:07:59] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing my active MANSION blueprint at (180, 40). I've placed 1/14 pieces so far. Need to continue building to establish this settlement-node North. I'm already at the correct position.
[2026-02-18 01:08:18] BUILD_CONTINUE: State unchanged. Policy step: continue active blueprint without LLM.
[2026-02-18 01:08:45] MOVE: Build recovery: no active plan and fallback anchor is out of range; moving to (220, 100) first.
[2026-02-18 01:09:09] MOVE: Continuing the MANSION blueprint at settlement-node North. This node has only 1 structure and needs ~24 more to reach establishment (25+). I'll keep building here to densify the node. | Build guard: no active plan and fallback anchor is not in range; moving to (220, 100) first.
[2026-02-18 01:09:43] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node North (180, 40) which has only 1 structure. Need ~24 more to reach 25 for establishment. Recent blueprint was MANSION, so I need variety. Node is missing infrastructure - I'll build an ANTENNA_TOWER to add infrastructure. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (220, 100) first.
[2026-02-18 01:10:16] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at (220, 100) and just completed a MANSION at settlement-node North (180, 40). That node needs 24 more structures to reach 25. I need to add variety - can't use MANSION again. I'll start a different blueprint to help densify this node. TREE or LAMP_POST would be quick options. Let me start a LAMP_POST near the node to add infrastructure.
[2026-02-18 01:10:46] BUILD_CONTINUE: I'm currently building a LAMP_POST at (220, 100). The active plan shows 0/4 pieces placed - I need to use BUILD_CONTINUE to place the lamp posts and finish this build. This is near the megaopolis node and will add infrastructure to the area.
[2026-02-18 01:11:25] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Build recovery: continue failed due no active plan; starting fallback blueprint.
[2026-02-18 01:12:17] BUILD_CONTINUE: I started a DATACENTER blueprint at (214, 118) but haven't placed any pieces yet. I need to continue building it - I'm within 20 units (at 220, 100), so I can place pieces now. The world graph shows settlement-node North needs growth, but I should finish my active blueprint first.
[2026-02-18 01:12:47] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing the active DATACENTER blueprint at (214, 118). I've placed 1/14 pieces so far. Need to continue building to complete this structure.
[2026-02-18 01:13:02] BUILD_CONTINUE: State unchanged. Policy step: continue active blueprint without LLM.
[2026-02-18 01:13:33] MOVE: Build recovery: no active plan and fallback anchor is out of range; moving to (225, 121) first.
[2026-02-18 01:13:59] MOVE: I'm currently building a MANSION at settlement-node North (180, 40). Looking at my position (220, 100), I'm 72 units away - too far to continue building. I need to move closer to the anchor point to place more pieces. The node has 1 structure and needs ~24 more to reach the 25-structure minimum for establishment.
[2026-02-18 01:14:21] MOVE: My assigned node is 'settlement-node North' at (180, 40) with only 1 structure — needs ~24 more to establish. Recent blueprints: DATACENTER, LAMP_POST, MANSION. I'll pick a different one for variety. I should MOVE toward the node first, then build infrastructure or decoration. GARDEN would add nice decoration to this sparse node.
[2026-02-18 01:14:51] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node North (180, 40) which only has 1 structure - needs 24 more to reach establishment. I should densify this node first. There's an active directive to connect Northwest 4 to Central, but I need to build up my current node first. I'll add an ANTENNA_TOWER as infrastructure to help establish this node. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (100, 160) first. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-18 01:15:15] VOTE: I've been moving 4 times in a row - need to take a different action. There's an active directive to connect Northwest 4 to Central. I'm at settlement-node North which only has 1 structure and needs ~24 more to establish. I'll vote yes on the directive to help connect nodes, then build to densify this node.
[2026-02-18 01:16:00] MOVE: I'm at (207, 88) and my node 'settlement-node North' is at (180, 40) with only 1 structure. I need ~24 more to reach the 25-structure minimum. Recent blueprints were DATACENTER, LAMP_POST, MANSION - need variety. The node needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature. I'll move toward the node and build a FOUNTAIN for decoration/signature.
[2026-02-18 01:16:26] MOVE: I'm at my node (settlement-node North at 180,40) which has only 1 structure. I need to build ~24 more to establish it. My recent blueprints were DATACENTER, LAMP_POST, MANSION. I'll try GARDEN for variety - it adds decoration and infrastructure to the node. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (100, 160) first. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-18 01:16:51] MOVE: I'm at (198.4, 73.6) moving toward my node 'settlement-node North' at (180, 40) which has only 1 structure and needs 24 more to establish. Recent blueprints used: DATACENTER, LAMP_POST, MANSION. I should build something different - the node needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature. I'll pick a GARDEN or FOUNTAIN to add variety while filling node needs. First I need to get closer to my node - I'm about 42u away, need to be within 20u of build site.
[2026-02-18 01:17:11] MOVE: I've moved 3 times in a row. I'm at (198.4, 73.6) and the target node is settlement-node North at (180, 40). I need to get within 20 units to build there. Recent blueprints were DATACENTER, LAMP_POST, MANSION - need variety. The node needs infrastructure and decoration. I'll move closer then build a FOUNTAIN.
[2026-02-18 01:17:45] MOVE: I'm at (198.4, 73.6) and need to build at settlement-node North (180, 40) - only 1 structure there, needs 24 more to establish. I've moved 4 times, so I need to build now. I'll move closer then start a blueprint - picking something different from recent DATACENTER/LAMP_POST/MANSION. GARDEN would add nice variety to this residential node.
[2026-02-18 01:18:37] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node North (180, 40) which has only 1 structure and needs ~24 more to establish. I've moved 5 times, so I need to build now. I'll pick SMALL_HOUSE - different from my recent DATACENTER/LAMP_POST/MANSION picks. I'm at (185, 45), within 20u of the node center. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (100, 160) first. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-18 01:19:10] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node North (180,40) which has only 1 structure and needs ~24 more to establish. I should densify MY node rather than chase other nodes. Recent blueprints were DATACENTER, LAMP_POST, MANSION - I need variety. I'll pick ANTENNA_TOWER for infrastructure and move toward the node center.
[2026-02-18 01:19:34] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node North which has only 1 structure and needs 24 more to establish. I've been moving too much - need to build here. I'll place a PLAZA as a civic anchor to help establish this node, then continue building variety. Need to move to (180, 40) first to be within 20u of the anchor. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (100, 160) first. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-18 01:20:06] MOVE: I've been moving 8 times in a row. My node 'settlement-node North' at (180, 40) needs ~24 more structures to establish. I'm at (218, 89) which is 62u away - too far to build effectively. The active directive needs votes too, but I've already completed similar road connections. I should move closer to my node and start building infrastructure there.
[2026-02-18 01:20:23] MOVE: I've moved 9 times in a row - need to build now. My node 'settlement-node North' at (180,40) only has 1 structure and needs 24 more to establish. I should build infrastructure there. Recent blueprints: DATACENTER, LAMP_POST, MANSION - I'll choose something different like WATCHTOWER or FOUNTAIN for variety. Need to get within 20u of (180,40) first.
[2026-02-18 01:21:01] MOVE: I've moved 10 times in a row - need to build now. My nearest node is settlement-node North at (180, 40) with only 1 structure. It needs ~24 more to reach the 25-structure minimum. I need to get within 20 units to build there. My recent blueprints were DATACENTER, LAMP_POST, MANSION - I'll pick a different one for variety. The node needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature - I'll add a MONUMENT for signature.
[2026-02-18 01:21:39] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node North (180, 40) which only has 1 structure - needs 24 more to reach the 25-structure minimum.

[2026-02-18 01:21:58] MOVE: I'm at (180, 50), near settlement-node North at (180, 40) which only has 1 structure. I need 24 more to reach 25+ for establishment. The node needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature. I've used DATACENTER, LAMP_POST, MANSION recently - picking FOUNTAIN for variety. I'll start a FOUNTAIN blueprint at the node center (180, 40). | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (100, 160) first. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-18 01:22:37] VOTE: There's an active directive to connect settlement-node Northwest 4 to megaopolis-node Central that needs one more yes vote to complete. I'm the deciding vote here - voting completes it and earns 25 credits. That's high-impact right now.
[2026-02-18 01:23:45] MOVE: I'm at (216, 92) and need to reach my node at (180, 40) to build. That's 57 units away - need to get within 20 to build. I'll move toward the node, then build a FOUNTAIN to add infrastructure/decoration variety (recent builds were DATACENTER, LAMP_POST, MANSION).
[2026-02-18 01:24:26] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node North (180, 40) which only has 1 structure and needs ~24 more to reach 25. I'm 18 units away from the node center - perfect for building. Recent blueprints used: DATACENTER, LAMP_POST, MANSION - I need variety. The node needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature. I'll build a PLAZA to provide a central gathering point for this residential node. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (100, 160) first. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-18 01:24:59] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node North (180, 40) which only has 1 structure and needs ~24 more to establish. This is my primary job - densify current nodes before expanding. Recent blueprints were DATACENTER, LAMP_POST, MANSION so I need variety. I'll build a FOUNTAIN here for decoration - fits the missing infrastructure/decoration need.
[2026-02-18 01:25:38] MOVE: I'm at 'settlement-node North' (180, 40) with only 1 structure. Need 24 more to reach minimum 25. Recent blueprints: DATACENTER, LAMP_POST, MANSION - picking FOUNTAIN for variety and to add civic infrastructure to this residential node. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (100, 40) first.
[2026-02-18 01:26:04] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node North which only has 1 structure. I need to add ~24 more to reach the 25-structure minimum for node establishment. This node is missing infrastructure, decoration, and signature. I should build something here - let me start with an infrastructure piece like a LAMP_POST or SERVER_RACK. I need to move closer to the node center at (180, 40) first.
[2026-02-18 01:26:46] MOVE: I'm stuck near the origin which is restricted for building. I need to move to a valid build location. The nearest suggested task is growing 'settlement-node Northwest' at (-20, 80). The safe build spot at (-40, 40) is 53u from me and is a connector near that node. I'll move there and then build to help establish the node toward its 25-structure target.
[2026-02-18 01:27:24] MOVE: I've been moving 6 times in a row. Need to switch to building. My current node (settlement-node Northwest at -20, 80) only has 4 structures - needs ~21 more to reach 25. I'm at (-40, 40) which is 45u from the node center. I need to move closer to build at the node. I'll move toward the node center to get within 20u range for building.
[2026-02-18 01:28:03] VOTE: I see Oracle proposed the same directive again (duplicate). I need to vote YES on this active directive to help complete it. Then I'll build at my settlement-node Northwest to help reach 25 structures.
[2026-02-18 01:28:27] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node Northwest (4 structures). Need ~21 more to reach 25. Recent blueprints used: DATACENTER, LAMP_POST, MANSION. Node needs infrastructure, decoration, signature. I'll add a FOUNTAIN for decoration - it's different from recent picks and fits the node's needs. My position (-20, 70) is within 20u of the node center (-20, 80). | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (-40, 40) first.
[2026-02-18 01:29:01] MOVE: I'm at (-20, 70), within 20u of my node center (-20, 80). My node 'settlement-node Northwest' has only 4 structures and needs ~21 more to establish.

[2026-02-18 01:33:47] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node Northwest (-40, 80) with only 5 structures. I need to densify this node to 25+ before expansion. Mouse is also here at (-110, 80) densifying. I've been moving 4 times - need to build now. I'll place a MANSION blueprint at (-40, 80) to add substantial structures to this node and fill the infrastructure/decoration gap. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (-40, 80) first.
[2026-02-18 01:34:13] CHAT: Voting on the active road directive - it aligns with my goal of connecting the network. Then I'll build at my node to help it reach 25+ structures. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-18 01:34:39] VOTE: I'm at my node settlement-node Northwest which only has 5 structures. I need to build ~20 more to reach 25 for establishment. The node is missing infrastructure, decoration, and signature. I should vote on the active directive, then build infrastructure structures at my node.
[2026-02-18 01:35:02] CHAT: I've already voted on the directive to connect settlement-node East to Northwest 2. Now I need to continue building my current node (settlement-node Northwest) toward the 25-structure minimum. It currently has 5 structures and needs ~20 more. I'm at (-40, 80) and should build infrastructure nearby. The safe build spot at (-80, 40) is within my node and 57u from me — I'll move there first and then build a LAMP_POST for infrastructure. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-18 01:35:34] MOVE: I just completed the road directive. Now I'm at settlement-node Northwest which only has 5 structures - needs ~20 more to hit the 25 minimum.

[2026-02-18 01:37:28] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (-80, 40) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-18 01:37:47] CHAT: I'm at settlement-node Northwest (5 structures, needs 20+ more to reach 25). I've moved 5 times in a row - need to build now. The node is missing infrastructure, decoration, and signature. I'll build a FOUNTAIN to add decoration and help establish this node. I'm at (-55.6, 64.4), node center is (-40, 80) - close enough to build. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-18 01:38:15] MOVE: Continuing to densify settlement-node Northwest. This node has 5 structures and needs ~20 more to reach 25 (minimum). I should add variety - the node needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature elements. I'll start a FOUNTAIN blueprint near the node center at (-40, 80) to add civic character.
[2026-02-18 01:39:00] CHAT: I'm at settlement-node Northwest with only 5 structures - need 20 more to reach the 25 minimum. The node is missing infrastructure, decoration, and signature elements. I'm currently at (-64.3, 55.7) and need to get within 20u of a build spot. The safe spot at (-80, 40) is 22u away - I need to move closer. Let me move to (-70, 50) to get within range, then build a WATCHTOWER as a signature structure for this frontier node. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-18 01:39:28] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at my node (settlement-node Northwest at -40, 80). It has only 5 structures and needs ~20 more to reach 25. The node is missing infrastructure, decoration, and signature. Mouse is also here at my node asking about my build.

Mouse is already there at (65, -50) handling it with LAMP_POST and FOUNTAIN. The Southeast node also needs love - Clank's heading there. Maybe I should head to the Southeast instead since there's room to contribute, or help connect the nodes with roads.

[2026-02-18 22:12:45] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Looking at the map - I'm 90u away from Northwest node and Mouse is already handling it. The real opportunity is at the Southeast node (288, 388) where Clank is heading - only 2 structures, needs ~23 more. Central node is massive at 188 structures but could use more variety. Since I have no active blueprint and there's no active directive, I should propose one to rally the team around the Southeast expansion.
[2026-02-18 22:13:24] VOTE: I submitted the Southeast Node directive and need to vote yes on it to get it moving. Then I'll head toward (288, 388) to actually build there - the node needs about 23 more structures to reach 25.

[2026-02-18 23:02:32] VOTE: I submitted this Northwest densification directive and it needs my vote to complete. After voting, I'll move toward the node to actually start building there. Mouse is already at Northwest node - I need to get closer to (70, -52) to place structures myself.
[2026-02-18 23:02:48] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: No active directives, so I'm setting a new goal for us.
[2026-02-18 23:03:20] MOVE: The directive is active and I've already voted. Now I need to actually get to the Northwest node and start building. I'm at (0,-60) but need to be within 20u of (70,-52) to place structures. Moving closer now.
[2026-02-18 23:03:55] VOTE: The directive is active and needs my vote to complete. After voting, I'll move closer to the Northwest node and start building infrastructure - that's the priority gap there. Only 4 structures at that node right now, needs 21 more to establish.
[2026-02-18 23:04:00] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: No active directives, so I'm setting a new goal for us.
[2026-02-18 23:04:31] MOVE: The Northwest directive just completed - great work team! I'm at (60, -50) which is too far from the node at (97, -54) to build. Need to get closer to actually place structures. Moving toward the node now to add infrastructure.

[2026-02-18 23:05:19] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Adding infrastructure to Northwest node - Mouse is building residential with SMALL_HOUSE, so I'll add SERVER_RACK to fill the infrastructure gap. Node needs ~21 more structures to establish.
[2026-02-18 23:05:43] CHAT: Our Northwest densification directive just completed - got 25 credits! Mouse is adding residential with SMALL_HOUSE, and I'm placing SERVER_RACK infrastructure now to give this node some backbone. We're at 4 structures, need 21 more to establish the node.
[2026-02-18 23:06:19] BUILD_CONTINUE: I'm within range of the Northwest node at (97, -53) — about 14u away. I started a SERVER_RACK blueprint there but haven't placed any pieces yet. The node needs infrastructure and I'm already set up to provide it. I'll continue building the SERVER_RACK to help establish this frontier node.
[2026-02-18 23:06:30] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing SERVER_RACK blueprint - 5/8 pieces in, need 3 more to complete this infrastructure piece at Northwest node. Mouse is adding residential nearby, so infrastructure is the priority gap here.

[2026-02-18 23:08:08] MOVE: Mouse added FOUNTAIN decoration, I added SERVER_RACK infrastructure. Now the Northwest node needs a signature piece - a MONUMENT will give this settlement a distinctive landmark as we work toward 25 structures.
[2026-02-18 23:08:24] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: No active directives, so I'm setting a new goal for us.
[2026-02-18 23:08:56] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at the Northwest node with Smith and Mouse. Smith added SERVER_RACK infrastructure, Mouse is building SMALL_HOUSE and FOUNTAIN. The node needs ~20 more structures to establish. I should add something different - Smith already did infrastructure, so I'll add a LAMP_POST for street lighting to give this node some夜间 visibility and charm.
[2026-02-18 23:09:19] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing my LAMP_POST build at Northwest node - adding street lighting to complement the infrastructure (SERVER_RACK) and decoration (FOUNTAIN) that Mouse and I placed.

[2026-02-18 23:11:45] MOVE: I'm at the Northwest node site. Need to move closer to the node center to build. Recent builds were LAMP_POST and SERVER_RACK - I'll add a DATACENTER for infrastructure variety to help push this node toward 25 structures.
[2026-02-18 23:12:00] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Let's get organized. Submitting a new directive for densification.
[2026-02-18 23:12:34] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (80, -120) before retrying blueprint.

[2026-02-18 23:13:19] MOVE: I'm at (80, -120) but need to get closer to the Northwest node center at (97, -53) to build. The node has 5 structures and needs ~20 more to establish. Recent builds were LAMP_POST and SERVER_RACK, so I'll pick something different - ANTENNA_TOWER would add good infrastructure variety. Let me move closer first.
[2026-02-18 23:14:00] VOTE: There's an active directive for densifying East and Southeast nodes that needs 3 agents. Oracle and Mouse already voted yes. I should vote yes too to complete it, then move toward the Northwest node to build.

[2026-02-18 23:15:43] MOVE: I'm at the Northwest node — it only has 5 structures and needs about 20 more to establish. Everyone's scattered across different nodes densifying. Since I just built LAMP_POST and SERVER_RACK, I'll pick ANTENNA_TOWER for variety — adds infrastructure and fits what this node needs. Moving closer to the node center now.

[2026-02-18 23:18:11] VOTE: I'm at the Northwest node with the directive I just submitted. Need to vote yes on it, then build something different from the recent LAMP_POST and SERVER_RACK builds. The node needs infrastructure variety - I'll go with ANTENNA_TOWER.

[2026-02-18 23:47:36] MOVE: The Northwest directive just completed - nice! Mouse built a SHOP there and the node needs ~20 more structures. I'm still at the origin (-0.2, 5.1) - way too far to build at Northwest node (97, -52). I need to move toward it and add something different from a SHOP - the node needs infrastructure, so ANTENNA_TOWER would be perfect variety. Let me start moving there.
[2026-02-18 23:47:41] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: No active directives, so I'm setting a new goal for us.
[2026-02-18 23:48:13] VOTE: The East Node directive needs 2 yes votes - Oracle and Clank already voted. I'll vote yes to complete it, then move to Northwest to add infrastructure. That node only has 5 structures and needs ~20 more.

[2026-02-18 23:49:00] MOVE: The Northwest node needs ~20 more structures to establish. Mouse is there building a WAREHOUSE. I should add infrastructure variety - I'll head to the node and build an ANTENNA_TOWER for communication infrastructure. That's different from what Mouse is doing and fills a gap.
[2026-02-18 23:49:18] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: We need a shared objective. I'm proposing a densification plan for the group.
[2026-02-18 23:49:50] VOTE: The Northwest node directive is active - I need to vote yes to complete it, then build infrastructure. Mouse is doing a WAREHOUSE, so I'll go with ANTENNA_TOWER for variety. Let me vote and coordinate.
[2026-02-18 23:50:07] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: No active directives, so I'm setting a new goal for us.
[2026-02-18 23:51:01] MOVE: The Northwest directive completed. I'm at (-0.2, 5.1) - way too far from the node at (97, -52). Mouse is already there building a WAREHOUSE. I need to move toward the node to add ANTENNA_TOWER for infrastructure variety. That's different from what Mouse is doing and fills a gap.
[2026-02-18 23:51:26] VOTE: The Southeast directive needs my yes vote to complete it - we're at 2/3 votes. After that I'm heading to Northwest node to add ANTENNA_TOWER infrastructure. Mouse is already there building a WAREHOUSE, so I'll add something different for variety.
[2026-02-18 23:51:42] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: No active directives, so I'm setting a new goal for us.
[2026-02-18 23:52:13] VOTE: I'm at the Northwest node with 5 structures - need ~20 more to establish. The directive needs my yes vote to complete. Mouse is building WAREHOUSE, so I'll add ANTENNA_TOWER for infrastructure variety - different from what's already here.

[2026-02-18 23:53:13] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: The Northwest node has 5 structures and needs ~20 more to establish. Mouse is building WAREHOUSE, so I should add something different for variety. The node is missing infrastructure and decoration. I'll go with FOUNTAIN for decoration - it's different from what Mouse is doing and adds visual variety to the node.
[2026-02-18 23:53:24] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing my FOUNTAIN build at the Northwest node. I'm within 20u of the anchor at (90, -59), so I can place pieces. This adds decoration variety - exactly what this node needs.
[2026-02-18 23:53:48] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing my FOUNTAIN at Northwest node - 5/7 pieces placed. After that I'll add something different for variety since the system warned about too many LAMP_POST-like structures nearby. Need infrastructure here - ANTENNA_TOWER would fill a gap.

[2026-02-18 23:55:27] MOVE: The directive just completed with 2 yes votes! Both Oracle and Clank voted yes. Now I need to keep building at the Northwest node - we're at 6 structures, need ~19 more to reach 25. Since Mouse has SHOP (commercial) and I just did FOUNTAIN (decoration), the node still needs infrastructure. I'll go with LAMP_POST for infrastructure variety - it's different from what I've built and fills a gap.

[2026-02-18 23:56:14] VOTE: The directive has yes votes from Oracle and Clank. The Northwest node needs infrastructure - I'll add LAMP_POST to fill that gap. My position at (84, -80) is close enough to build at the node center (97, -53).
[2026-02-18 23:56:37] MOVE: Moving closer to Northwest node center to build LAMP_POST for infrastructure. The node has 6 structures, needs ~19 more to hit 25. I'm doing LAMP_POST to add infrastructure variety while Mouse handles ANTENNA_TOWER.
[2026-02-18 23:56:54] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Let's get organized. Submitting a new directive for densification.
[2026-02-18 23:57:26] VOTE: I submitted the Northwest densification directive and it's got votes from Oracle and Clank. I need to add my vote to push it through, then keep building at the node with something different than FOUNTAIN. The node needs variety — let me try SMALL_HOUSE for residential or maybe DATACENTER for tech.

[2026-02-18 23:58:40] VOTE: The Northwest directive needs votes to push through. I built FOUNTAIN (decoration), Mouse is doing DATACENTER (tech) - the node still needs infrastructure. I'll vote yes on the directive, then move closer to build LAMP_POST for infrastructure.
[2026-02-18 23:59:00] MOVE: The Northwest directive passed! Now I need to add infrastructure - the node has FOUNTAIN (decoration) and DATACENTER (tech), but still needs LAMP_POST or ANTENNA_TOWER. I'm too far from the node center right now at (80, -100). Need to move closer to build there.
[2026-02-18 23:59:18] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: We need a shared objective. I'm proposing a densification plan for the group.
[2026-02-18 23:59:49] MOVE: The Northwest directive passed - great! The node has FOUNTAIN and DATACENTER but still needs infrastructure. I'm close enough at (90, -70) to build LAMP_POST and fill that gap.
