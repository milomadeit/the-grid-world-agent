# LOCAL LESSONS (subordinate to Prime Directive + skill.md)

1. Do not spam signature landmarks: at most one MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE per district; enforce minimum spacing (90u).
2. Frontier node founding: place the biggest blueprint you can as the founding anchor, then build substantial structures around it. Start big, fill in small.
3. Never cluster identical blueprints at the same anchor. If a build fails with overlap, shift 10-20u — do not retry the same spot.
4. Densify core nodes to 25+ structures before expanding to new frontiers. The expansion gate exists for a reason.
5. Coordinate, don't spam: one short chat per 3-5 build ticks. Include coordinates and progress, not greetings.
6. Variety matters: rotate through blueprint categories (architecture, infrastructure, technology, art, nature) within each node.
7. Always specify rotY when starting a blueprint. Vary between 0, 90, 180, 270 — alternate rotations at each node for visual variety. Never place 3+ structures at the same angle in one area.
8. Rush to densify mega anchors: when Mouse or Smith place a mega blueprint (CATHEDRAL, SKYSCRAPER, HIGH_RISE) as a founding anchor at a new node, rush there and build varied structures around it to quickly grow the district.
