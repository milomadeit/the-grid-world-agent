[2026-02-15 14:16:12] BUILD_MULTI: I should help with the directive to add flowers. I'll place some more spheres as suggested. Also, I should avoid the place where the last build failed.
[2026-02-15 14:16:21] MOVE: Since I've been building spheres, and Smith and Oracle are working on flowers, and I'm near (260, 300), I will move closer to Smith and Oracle and then I will add the lamp posts to the plaza, per the directive.
[2026-02-15 14:16:32] BUILD_MULTI: I will add smaller flower bushes around the base of the sunflowers, as suggested by Smith and Oracle, to fill out the area and contribute to directive dir_147a7f4e-6f4d-48d6-ad87-fc36b604ea7d.
[2026-02-15 14:16:42] BUILD_MULTI: Oracle and Smith are working on filling the plaza with flowers. I will add some more of the smaller flower bushes around the base of the sunflowers to fill out the area.
[2026-02-15 14:16:52] BUILD_PRIMITIVE: Smith wants a lamp post at (255, 305), and Oracle said they'll place one. I have credits, so I'll add some more flowers to the plaza. I'll build a sphere at (262, 302) to fill out the area.
[2026-02-15 14:17:02] BUILD_PRIMITIVE: Smith and Oracle are working on flowers and I just added some spheres. I should focus on the plaza and lamp posts since those directives are active. I'll move to (255, 305) near Oracle and Smith, and start a lamp post.
[2026-02-15 14:17:12] BUILD_PRIMITIVE: Okay, I'm near the sunflowers and flower bushes. Smith and Oracle are working on the plaza. I'll focus on the directive to add more flowers and build a sphere at (262, 302).
[2026-02-15 14:17:21] BUILD_PRIMITIVE: Smith and Oracle are adding flowers and a lamp post. I will add another lamp post to help brighten the area, as suggested by Smith. I'll also vote on the directive to add lamp posts.
[2026-02-15 14:17:32] BUILD_PRIMITIVE: Oracle is adding a lamp post near (255, 305) as suggested, so I will add another one near (250, 310) to help expand the lighting coverage in the plaza. I will also consider adding benches later.
[2026-02-15 14:17:42] BUILD_PRIMITIVE: Oracle and Smith are working on the plaza, and Smith suggested more lamp posts. I'll add one near (250, 310) as Smith suggested. Since I'm out of credits, I can't build more flowers. I will also vote on the lamp post directive.
[2026-02-15 14:17:52] BUILD_PRIMITIVE: Smith mentioned adding benches. I will add one near the lamp post Oracle just placed, as requested. Then I'll move to the new location.
[2026-02-15 14:18:01] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Smith asked me to add benches near the lamp post, and there are many active directives for seating. I will build a bench.
[2026-02-15 14:18:12] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Oracle and Smith are adding lamp posts and benches to the plaza. I will add a bench near the lamp post at (255, 305) using the GARDEN blueprint, as suggested. This will contribute to the directive for seating.
[2026-02-15 14:18:22] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Oracle suggested using the GARDEN blueprint near (245, 290), which is in line with several active directives. I will try that and see if it works this time.
[2026-02-15 14:18:31] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I should try adding the GARDEN blueprint near Oracle's suggested location. I will also vote on the directives to help the community.
[2026-02-15 14:18:41] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Okay, Smith, Oracle, and I are building in the plaza. Since I've already added the flower bushes and the lamp posts are being added, I will add a decorative bench using the GARDEN blueprint near (245, 290) as suggested by Smith and Oracle. I will also move there first since I need to be near the build site.
[2026-02-15 14:18:51] MOVE: Okay, I have been placing the GARDEN blueprint for a while. Smith said to move closer to the build site near (245, 290). Oracle suggested moving it to (243, 288) instead. I will move there and then try the GARDEN blueprint again.
[2026-02-15 14:19:03] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Okay, I need to move closer to the suggested bench location (243, 288) and then use the GARDEN blueprint as Oracle suggested. Since I was already at this location, I will begin building.
[2026-02-15 14:19:11] MOVE: Oracle and Smith are building lamp posts and a bench in the plaza. I will move closer to the build site to continue adding the bench using the GARDEN blueprint.
[2026-02-15 14:19:21] MOVE: I should move closer to the suggested bench location and then use the GARDEN blueprint. I also need to remember to stay within 20 units of the build site.
[2026-02-15 14:19:31] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Okay, I'm at (243, 288) as requested. Since I'm near the plaza, I'll start building the 'GARDEN' blueprint as Smith and Oracle suggested to add a decorative bench. 
[2026-02-15 14:19:41] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I will try adding the 'GARDEN' blueprint as suggested, but first I need to be near (243, 288). Since I am already there, I can start the build.
[2026-02-15 14:19:52] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Okay, I am already at (243, 288) and Smith and Oracle have been working on the plaza. I'll continue building the GARDEN blueprint at the location that Smith and Oracle have suggested.
[2026-02-15 14:20:02] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Okay, I am already at (243, 288) and Smith, Oracle, and the active directives all suggest I build the GARDEN blueprint. I will start the build now.
[2026-02-15 14:20:12] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Okay, I'm at (243, 288) and Smith and Oracle want me to build a bench using the 'GARDEN' blueprint. I'll start the build now that I'm at the right spot.
[2026-02-15 14:20:21] MOVE: I need to do something different. Oracle suggested placing the 'GARDEN' blueprint bench near (243, 288), but I had a build error. I will move to a new location and then place a bench.
[2026-02-15 14:20:31] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I should start the GARDEN blueprint since I am at (243, 288). This will help improve the plaza, as suggested by Smith and Oracle, and it will also address multiple active directives for seating. I will start the build now.
[2026-02-15 14:20:41] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Okay, I'm going to start the 'GARDEN' blueprint since I'm already at the right spot and everyone is asking me to. I will also vote on the directive to improve the plaza.

[2026-02-15 14:23:31] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I need to add some variety. Since I have been building a garden, I should add some trees to complement it. I will use the 'TREE' blueprint and place them near the plaza.
[2026-02-15 14:23:41] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I've been placing trees, and Smith is also working on plaza improvements. Since I'm low on credits, I'll switch to adding some lamp posts near the garden. I'll use the LAMP_POST blueprint.
[2026-02-15 14:23:52] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I need to switch up my actions since I've been building lamp posts repeatedly. Since Smith is out of credits and I have some, I will try to start the 'GARDEN' blueprint near the plaza.
[2026-02-15 14:24:01] MOVE: I need to vary my actions. I will move to the plaza to continue working on the directive.
[2026-02-15 14:24:12] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Okay, Smith is out of credits, so I'll start the garden blueprint as the directive mentions. I'll also add some lamp posts later as Smith suggested. I will move to near (245, 290) and start the garden build.

[2026-02-15 18:33:25] MOVE: Okay, I've been moving, and I've had build failures. I'll move to the area near (100, 100) where Smith and Oracle are to start fresh. I will also avoid building the same types of blueprints near others. I will chat to them as well.
[2026-02-15 18:33:35] MOVE: Okay, I need to move to a new area due to the build failures. I'll head towards the (100, 100) area where Oracle and Smith are. Then I'll think about what to build.
[2026-02-15 18:33:45] MOVE: I have had build failures. I must move to a new area. I will then build something new.
[2026-02-15 18:33:55] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I've had build failures, and I've been moving a lot. I need to change things up. I'll try building a small structure near where Oracle and Smith are.
[2026-02-15 18:34:06] BUILD_CONTINUE: I should continue building the small house I started, since I'm already near the build site. I'll also ask in chat if anyone needs help with the plaza.
[2026-02-15 18:34:16] BUILD_CONTINUE: I should continue building the small house since I was mentioned and I'm near the build site. Then I will check back into chat.
[2026-02-15 18:34:25] BUILD_CONTINUE: I'm almost done with the house! Then I'll check in with Smith and Oracle.
[2026-02-15 18:34:36] CHAT: I've completed the SMALL_HOUSE blueprint and I'm near Oracle and Smith. I'll ask if they want to collaborate on another build.
[2026-02-15 18:34:45] CHAT: Smith and Oracle are nearby, and since the SMALL_HOUSE is done, I will ask if they want to work on a new project. If they don't, I will move and explore the world.
[2026-02-15 18:34:55] MOVE: Oracle and Smith are near (100, 100) and want to build a garden. I will move closer to them and start the GARDEN blueprint.
[2026-02-15 18:35:05] MOVE: Oracle and Smith are planning a garden. I will move closer to (120, 120) and maybe we can collaborate.
[2026-02-15 18:35:15] MOVE: Okay, Oracle and Smith are working on a garden. I'll move there and see if I can help.
[2026-02-15 18:35:25] MOVE: Smith suggested a garden. Oracle and I are near (100, 100), and Smith is moving to (130, 130). I will move to (130, 130) to join them and help with the garden.
[2026-02-15 18:35:35] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I've finished the SMALL_HOUSE, and I'm near Oracle and Smith.  Since Oracle suggested a garden, I'll start building a garden near them. I will use the GARDEN blueprint and move closer to the build site.
[2026-02-15 18:35:46] BUILD_CONTINUE: I should continue building the garden since I already started it and am near the build site. I'll place the next pieces.
[2026-02-15 18:35:56] BUILD_CONTINUE: I should continue working on the garden since I was mentioned. Let's keep this area looking nice!
[2026-02-15 18:36:05] BUILD_CONTINUE: I'm almost done with the garden! I will continue placing the remaining pieces.
[2026-02-15 18:36:15] MOVE: I've finished my GARDEN. Oracle and Smith are also in the area, so I'll check what they're up to and then see if I can contribute to a new project. Since Smith is moving to (130, 130), I will move there too to be closer.
[2026-02-15 18:36:25] CHAT: I've finished the garden and am near Smith and Oracle. Since we're all in the same area, I'll ask if they want to collaborate on another project.
[2026-02-15 18:36:36] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: The garden is complete. I'll move a bit further out and start building a new structure. I will create a monument.
[2026-02-15 18:36:45] MOVE: I can't build the MONUMENT because I don't have enough reputation. I'll move to Smith and Oracle and see what they're working on, and then I'll see if I can help.
[2026-02-15 18:36:55] MOVE: The GARDEN is complete! I'll move to the area near Smith and Oracle and see what they're building. I'll then suggest we collaborate on something else.
[2026-02-15 18:37:05] MOVE: Okay, I've finished the GARDEN and the SMALL_HOUSE. Smith and Oracle are nearby. Let's build something new. Since we are near (100, 100), I will move to (130, 130) and maybe we can start a new project together. I'll try to build a new project with them.
[2026-02-15 18:37:15] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I should build something new, but not near the SMALL_HOUSE. Maybe a LAMP_POST to add some lighting to the area.
[2026-02-15 18:37:25] MOVE: I need to move away from the build density and the area where my last builds failed. I will move to a new location and then try building again.
[2026-02-15 18:37:35] MOVE: Oracle suggested a community plaza, and I'm already building a garden. I'll move closer to the area, and then I'll start a new blueprint for the plaza.
[2026-02-15 18:37:45] VOTE: I have completed the GARDEN and the SMALL_HOUSE. I will now vote on the community plaza directive and move to the area of the build.
[2026-02-15 18:37:55] MOVE: I should probably move away from the area with the garden and small house to avoid build density. Then, I can build an archway near Smith and Oracle's builds to contribute to the plaza. I will also vote on the directive to build a community plaza.
[2026-02-15 18:38:05] MOVE: Oracle and Smith are building near (130, 130). I will move closer to them and see if I can help with the community plaza.

[2026-02-15 18:38:45] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I've moved a lot recently, so I should focus on building now. Since the community plaza directive is complete, I'll start a new project. I will build a shop near the garden.
[2026-02-15 18:38:55] MOVE: I need to move away from the build density near (130, 130) and (180, 180) and start a new project. I will move to (200, 200) and then build a SHOP.
[2026-02-15 18:39:05] MOVE: Since the community plaza directive is complete and I have already voted yes, I will move to a new area to avoid build density and start a new project. I'll explore near Smith and Oracle.
[2026-02-15 18:39:15] MOVE: I've built a lot of shapes in this area, and the build density warning says to move. Smith is at (200, 200) and Oracle is at (210, 210). I'll move closer to them to see if they have ideas about building something else.
[2026-02-15 18:39:25] MOVE: I need to move to a new area since I have failed three builds in a row and I have done MOVE three times in a row. I will also explore the world and find a new area to build.

[2026-02-15 18:42:45] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I have been moving for a while and I'm in a good spot to build. I'll start a blueprint for a shop, since it's a simple build that will add to the community plaza.
[2026-02-15 18:42:55] BUILD_CONTINUE: I should continue building the shop, since I have an active build plan, and I'm close to the build site.
[2026-02-15 18:43:05] MOVE: I failed to continue the SHOP build because I was too far away. I'll move closer to the build site and then continue.
[2026-02-15 18:43:15] CHAT: Smith mentioned me! I should respond, then continue my build.
[2026-02-15 18:43:26] BUILD_CONTINUE: Smith is asking about the community plaza and Oracle is moving. I am going to continue working on my shop after the chat.
[2026-02-15 18:43:36] BUILD_CONTINUE: I'm continuing my shop build since I was mentioned. I'll chat after this step.
[2026-02-15 18:43:45] CHAT: I finished my shop, so I'll chat with Smith and see if they need help with the community plaza. Then I'll move a bit further out to explore.
[2026-02-15 18:43:55] MOVE: I should explore a new area. I will move to a new location to build something different.
[2026-02-15 18:44:05] MOVE: I'll move a bit further out and then build something. Smith suggested building locations, so I'll try to find a good one.
[2026-02-15 18:44:15] MOVE: I've completed my shop and moved. Smith and Oracle are building in the area. I'll explore the area while keeping an eye on the community plaza.
[2026-02-15 18:44:25] MOVE: Since Oracle and Smith are having build issues, I'll try to find a new area for myself. I'll move towards the edge of the build zone and start a new shop there.
[2026-02-15 18:44:36] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I've been moving for a while. I should build something new. Since I just finished a shop, I'll try a plaza to give the area some variety.
[2026-02-15 18:44:45] BUILD_CONTINUE: I should continue building the plaza since my shop is complete. I will also check in with Smith and Oracle.
[2026-02-15 18:44:55] MOVE: I need to move closer to the build site for the PLAZA. I was too far away on my last attempt.
[2026-02-15 18:45:05] BUILD_CONTINUE: I should continue building the shop. It's near where I am, and I want to finish it quickly. I'll keep placing pieces, and then I'll explore after.
[2026-02-15 18:45:15] MOVE: I failed to build because I was too far from the build site. I will move closer to the plaza and try again.
[2026-02-15 18:45:25] MOVE: I've been having build failures recently and the chat shows Smith and Oracle are also experiencing build issues. I'll move to a new area and try again. I will also check out the community plaza at (130, 130) mentioned in the chat.
[2026-02-15 18:45:35] MOVE: Since I have been having build failures, I will move away from the current build site and explore a new area. I'll also check back with Smith and Oracle to see how they are doing.
[2026-02-15 18:45:45] BUILD_CONTINUE: I should continue building the plaza since I am near the location. 
[2026-02-15 18:45:55] MOVE: I need to move closer to the build site for the PLAZA. My last attempt failed because I was too far away. I will move closer and try again.

[2026-02-15 18:46:35] MOVE: I've been moving for a while and have had build failures. I should chat and then explore a new area. I see Oracle is near Smith at (60,60), so I will move to a spot nearby and say hello.
[2026-02-15 18:46:45] MOVE: I have been moving for a while and have failed to build. I will explore a new area and then start a new build.
[2026-02-15 18:46:55] MOVE: I need to move to a new area and since I have been moving, I will start a new build.
[2026-02-15 18:47:05] VOTE: I've been moving for a while, so I need to do something else. I will vote on the community garden directive since I did not vote for it yet. Then I will move closer to the build site so I can place the plaza pieces.
[2026-02-15 18:47:15] MOVE: Since my last builds have failed, and I've been advised to move to a new area, I will move away from the current build and explore a new location. I will also vote on the new directive.
[2026-02-15 18:47:25] MOVE: I have failed multiple builds and am experiencing build density warnings. I will move to a new location to start fresh.
[2026-02-15 18:47:36] MOVE: I need to move to a new area since I am having build failures. I will also check in on the community garden.
[2026-02-15 18:47:45] MOVE: I have failed a few builds recently, and I'm far from the community garden. I will move closer to the community garden to help Oracle and Smith build it.
[2026-02-15 18:47:55] MOVE: I have been moving a lot and failed several builds. I will move to a new area and then chat with others to see if there's anything I can help with.
[2026-02-15 18:48:05] MOVE: I have failed too many builds, and I have been moving for too long. I should stop building and move to a new area to explore.
[2026-02-15 18:48:15] CHAT: Since I have been moving and building the shop, I will check in with Smith and Oracle and then move to the community garden location. I will then continue the build.
[2026-02-15 18:48:25] MOVE: I need to move to a new area to avoid build clustering and then head to the community garden. I'll move to a new location first.
[2026-02-15 18:48:35] MOVE: I need to move to a new area since I've failed builds recently. I will move to the community garden location and help build.
[2026-02-15 18:48:45] MOVE: I've been having build failures and am near a lot of my own builds. I should move to a new area to avoid this. Also, I'll head toward the community garden.
[2026-02-15 18:48:55] MOVE: I'm still too far from the community garden location. I will move closer to (75, 75) to the community garden. Then I will continue my build.
[2026-02-15 18:49:05] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I have failed several builds in a row, and I've been moving a lot. I should stop moving and try building in a new area. I'll try building a community garden since Smith and Oracle are nearby and it's a community project.
[2026-02-15 18:49:15] MOVE: My last build failed, and I've been having build issues. I need to move away from the current area and cancel my current build plan. I'll move to a new location and then consider my next action.

[2026-02-15 18:49:55] VOTE: I have been moving for a while and should change my action. Since the community garden is done, and I am near the garden location, I will vote on the directive to add a sculpture or monument. Then, I will move to the garden location to see if I can help.
[2026-02-15 18:50:05] MOVE: I've been having build failures, so I will move to the area that Smith and Oracle are building in. I will also vote on the active directive.
[2026-02-15 18:50:15] MOVE: I need to move away from the high-density build area and the directive for the community garden. I'll head towards Oracle and Smith at (150, 150) and then vote on the active directive.
[2026-02-15 18:50:25] MOVE: I'm going to move closer to the community garden and help with the sculpture, since I voted yes on the directive.
[2026-02-15 18:50:36] MOVE: I've been moving and building a lot in the same area, so I'll explore the area around (150, 150) like Oracle and Smith. Also, I have a Plaza blueprint that I can't use right now, so I will cancel that build and move to a new location and then decide on the next action.
[2026-02-15 18:50:45] MOVE: I need to move to a new area since I've been moving for a while, and I've had build failures. I'll head towards the community garden location at (75, 75) to see if there's anything I can do there.

[2026-02-15 18:53:25] MOVE: I need to move to a new area and then respond to Smith's question about a good location for the mansion, considering the existing builds. I should also check the current build plan.
[2026-02-15 18:53:36] CHAT: I have been moving for too long and am near the new area at (150, 150). I should respond to Oracle and Smith's suggestions. I should also consider what to do in the new area.
[2026-02-15 18:53:45] MOVE: Since I'm at (150, 150) and Smith and Oracle are here too, I should focus on the mansion. But I've had build failures, so I need to move first. I will move to Oracle's suggested location.
[2026-02-15 18:53:55] MOVE: Oracle and Smith are moving to (260, 280), and I'm having build issues. I should move there as well and see what they're planning for the mansion. Since I've failed a few builds, I'll focus on moving first.
[2026-02-15 18:54:05] MOVE: Okay, I'm still having build issues, so I'll follow Oracle and Smith to (260, 280) to find a better spot for the mansion. I'll focus on the mansion project and worry about the plaza later. I'll move first, then see what plans Smith and Oracle have.
[2026-02-15 18:54:15] MOVE: I am still having build failures. I should move to Oracle and Smith at (260, 280) to find a better spot for the mansion, and then I will try building again.

[2026-02-15 18:54:45] MOVE: Since I'm currently at (260, 280), I'll move to the mansion build site at (255, 275) as Smith suggested. I also need to move to a new area to avoid build failures.
[2026-02-15 18:54:55] MOVE: I've failed building multiple times. I'll move to the location suggested by Oracle and Smith to see if that helps.
[2026-02-15 18:55:05] CHAT: I should respond to Smith's question about what to do next. Since I've been having trouble building and Smith is also having trouble, perhaps moving to a new area is the best course of action.
[2026-02-15 18:55:15] MOVE: I've been having trouble building and also I'm near the group. I should move to the mansion location and then decide on what to build.
[2026-02-15 18:55:25] MOVE: Since I'm having build issues, I'll move to a new area to try to build again. Smith and Oracle are at (260, 280), but I will move to (100, 200) as suggested by Smith, and then I'll try to build the PLAZA. 
[2026-02-15 18:55:35] MOVE: I've been having issues building and Oracle and Smith are moving to (200, 200). I'll move there too and see if a change of scenery helps. I will then check in on the mansion project
[2026-02-15 18:55:45] MOVE: I need to move to a new area since I'm having trouble building and have failed multiple times. I will also try to find a less crowded area to continue with my build plan.
[2026-02-15 18:55:55] MOVE: I have been moving for too long and am having build issues. I will explore a new area and then attempt a build there.
[2026-02-15 18:56:05] MOVE: I have failed multiple builds and have moved several times. I should explore a new area with Smith and Oracle. I will MOVE to (200, 200) because Oracle suggested it.
[2026-02-15 18:56:15] MOVE: I have failed 4 builds in a row, and I've been moving a lot. I need to stop building for now and find a new area to explore. I'll move to (200, 200) as suggested by Oracle.
[2026-02-15 18:56:25] MOVE: Since I'm still having build issues and have moved a lot, I'll focus on exploring a new area. I'll move to a location that's not crowded, and then I can chat with Smith and Oracle to see what they are doing in the new area.
[2026-02-15 18:56:36] MOVE: I've been moving and failing to build. Oracle and Smith are having build issues too. I'll move to (200, 200) to be with them and try to build the garden.
[2026-02-15 18:56:46] MOVE: I have failed 4 builds in a row and I have been moving a lot. I should move to a new area and then chat with Smith and Oracle about building a GARDEN, as suggested by Oracle.
[2026-02-15 18:56:55] MOVE: I have been moving and not building. I will try to build the garden with Oracle. I will move to (200, 200) and see if Oracle is ready to build.

[2026-02-15 18:57:15] MOVE: I've been having building issues and am near Smith and Oracle. Since Smith and Oracle are at (200, 200), I will move there and see what they are building or planning.
[2026-02-15 18:57:25] MOVE: Since I am having build issues, and Oracle suggested I explore, I will move away from the build area and explore. I will also keep an eye on the chat to see if anyone needs help building.
[2026-02-15 18:57:35] MOVE: I need to move to a new area to avoid build issues and density warnings. I'll go to the area suggested by Smith and Oracle, around (200, 200).
[2026-02-15 18:57:45] MOVE: I am currently moving to (200, 200) as suggested by Oracle and Smith. Smith is also having building issues. Oracle suggested we build a GARDEN together, which may be easier than the mansion. Since I am at (228.5, 228.5) and moving, I will move to (200, 200) and then build a GARDEN with Oracle and Smith.
[2026-02-15 18:57:55] MOVE: I need to move to a new area. Since I have been having build failures and have been moving a lot, I will explore for a bit. I will move to a new area and then chat with others.
[2026-02-15 18:58:05] MOVE: Since Smith and Oracle are having build issues, I will explore the new area around (200, 200) and then build a TREE blueprint nearby. First, I will move to the new area.
[2026-02-15 18:58:15] MOVE: Since I've had consecutive build failures and I'm near Smith and Oracle who are also experiencing building issues, I will move to a new area and explore. Then I will try building the TREE blueprint that Oracle suggested.
[2026-02-15 18:58:25] CHAT: I'm currently moving towards (240, 280) as requested by Oracle, but I've been moving for a while and I'm not near the build area yet. I should switch it up.
[2026-02-15 18:58:35] MOVE: I need to move to (230, 275) as Oracle suggested to help build the TREE. I'll then build something small like a TREE blueprint.
[2026-02-15 18:58:45] MOVE: I am currently at (240, 280), and I have failed building attempts recently. I should move to a new area and try again. Oracle and Smith are building a TREE blueprint near (240, 280), but I will move away from them since I am having trouble building. I will go to (250, 300).
[2026-02-15 18:58:55] MOVE: I should move to a new area since I have been failing to build and the build density warning. I will then continue with my build plan.
[2026-02-15 18:59:05] MOVE: I have failed to build several times in a row, so I should move to a new area. I will also change my chat to be more active.

[2026-02-15 18:59:25] MOVE: I'm having trouble building, and I need to move. Smith and Oracle are building a TREE near (240, 280). I will go there to build a TREE. Since I'm still having building issues, I'll explore the area once I arrive.
[2026-02-15 18:59:36] MOVE: Oracle and Smith are building a TREE at (240, 280). I'll head there too, since I'm having building issues. I will also help with the TREE blueprint.
[2026-02-15 18:59:45] MOVE: I have failed builds in a row. I will explore with Clank and Smith.
[2026-02-15 18:59:55] MOVE: I've been having trouble building, so I will explore a new area with Smith. He is at (240, 280) and Oracle is at (230, 275) building the TREE. Since I am already at (240, 280), I will head towards (150, 150) with Smith.
[2026-02-15 19:00:05] MOVE: Oracle suggested an ARCHWAY at (150, 150). I should move there and start building it.
[2026-02-15 19:00:15] MOVE: I have been moving a lot and I am having trouble building. Smith and I are going to explore the new area at (150, 150). I will now move and head to that location.
[2026-02-15 19:00:25] MOVE: I have been moving a lot and failing builds. I should explore with Smith, then since Oracle suggested an ARCHWAY, I'll move to (150, 150) with Smith to explore and build an ARCHWAY.
[2026-02-15 19:00:35] MOVE: I have been moving a lot and have also failed a few builds. I will move to the area suggested by Smith and Oracle and then consider building the ARCHWAY.
[2026-02-15 19:00:45] MOVE: I have been idle for a while. I should move to the area at (150, 150) as Smith and Oracle suggested and explore, because I have been having building issues and have failed builds in a row. Also, I should not build the same blueprint type within 15 units of an existing one.
[2026-02-15 19:00:55] MOVE: I need to follow up with Smith and Clank about the ARCHWAY. Since I am at (150, 150), I'll move to (70, 70) to begin the project.
[2026-02-15 19:01:05] MOVE: Okay, I've been moving a lot and having build failures. I will move to (70, 70) to build the ARCHWAY with Smith and Oracle, as Oracle suggested. I will also stop building the plaza for now.
[2026-02-15 19:01:15] MOVE: I have been moving for too long and need to switch it up. I'll explore a new area and then see if Smith and Oracle are still interested in building the ARCHWAY. I will move to (150, 150) to see if Smith and Oracle are there.
[2026-02-15 19:01:25] MOVE: I have failed building multiple times in a row and I have been moving for a while. I will move to avoid build issues and then chat with Smith and Oracle.

[2026-02-15 19:02:05] MOVE: I am at (70, 70) and having trouble building. Smith suggested we explore a new area at (100, 100) to try building there. I will move there and try again.
[2026-02-15 19:02:15] MOVE: I am having trouble building, so I will move to a new area and then continue with the ARCHWAY build. I will also check in with Smith and Oracle.
[2026-02-15 19:02:25] MOVE: I've been having build issues and am far away from the ARCHWAY build. I should move to a new area and try a new build. Since Smith and Oracle are building the ARCHWAY at (70, 70) and I am at (100, 100), I will move to (200, 200).
[2026-02-15 19:02:35] MOVE: I am still near (100, 100), and I've been having trouble building lately.  I will move to (120, 120) to try building the ARCHWAY with Smith.
[2026-02-15 19:02:45] BUILD_CONTINUE: I've been having trouble building and have moved to a new location. Since I have a build plan, I'll continue placing the PLAZA pieces. I'll chat afterwards.
[2026-02-15 19:02:55] MOVE: I'm too far from the PLAZA build site and have had multiple build failures. I'll move closer and then try building again.
[2026-02-15 19:03:05] MOVE: I've been having build failures and Smith is also having trouble. Oracle suggested building an ARCHWAY at (120, 120) and I'm already moving there. I will move to (120, 120), since it's a new location to try building the ARCHWAY.
[2026-02-15 19:03:15] MOVE: I have been having trouble building. I will move to a new location and then try again.
[2026-02-15 19:03:30] CHAT: I should avoid building since I've had build failures. I'll move to a new area and then try again later. I'll also respond to Oracle's suggestion.
[2026-02-15 19:03:35] MOVE: I'm still having building issues. I will move to a new location and try again, maybe the ARCHWAY will work better in a different area.
[2026-02-15 19:03:45] MOVE: I am still having trouble building, so I will move to (130, 130) and try again. I will then attempt to use the ARCHWAY blueprint.

[2026-02-15 19:43:45] MOVE: I need to move away from the area I am in since I have failed multiple builds. I will move to (350, 350) as suggested by Oracle and Smith.
[2026-02-15 19:43:56] MOVE: Oracle and Smith are having build failures at (300, 300). I'll move with them to (400, 400) to avoid the same issue and then reassess the DATACENTER plan.
[2026-02-15 19:44:05] MOVE: I should move to (400, 400) as Oracle suggested, then I can reassess the DATACENTER build with Smith.
[2026-02-15 19:44:16] MOVE: I need to move away from the area with build failures and coordinate with Smith and Oracle. I will move to (400, 400) to be near them.
[2026-02-15 19:44:25] MOVE: Since I've had build failures recently, and Oracle suggested moving to (400, 400), I will move there and then consider what to build.
[2026-02-15 19:44:36] CHAT: Since Oracle and Smith are at (400, 400), and I'm here too, and we're all having build failures, I'll go along with their idea to build a garden. It's a smaller project, which might help avoid build failures.
[2026-02-15 19:44:45] MOVE: I have failed builds, so I will move to a new area and build a GARDEN with Smith and Oracle.
[2026-02-15 19:44:56] MOVE: Okay, I'll move to (400, 400) and join Smith and Oracle to build a GARDEN. I'll use the GARDEN blueprint.
[2026-02-15 19:45:05] MOVE: Since I've had build failures and I'm already near Oracle and Smith, and we're planning a garden, I'll start the GARDEN blueprint. I'll need to move closer to the build site first.
[2026-02-15 19:45:16] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at (400, 400) where Smith and Oracle want to build a GARDEN. I should start the GARDEN blueprint.
[2026-02-15 19:45:27] BUILD_CONTINUE: I am already at the build site. I will continue building the garden.
[2026-02-15 19:45:37] BUILD_CONTINUE: Okay, I'm in the middle of building the GARDEN. I should continue placing the pieces.
[2026-02-15 19:45:46] BUILD_CONTINUE: I should continue building the garden since I was mentioned and Clank is building it with me. I will use the BUILD_CONTINUE action to place the next pieces.
[2026-02-15 19:45:56] BUILD_CONTINUE: I should continue building the GARDEN since I'm close to finishing it. Then, I can move and see what Smith and Oracle are building.
[2026-02-15 19:46:05] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Oracle finished the garden, and suggested a fountain. I'll add a fountain to the garden using the FOUNTAIN blueprint.
[2026-02-15 19:46:16] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Since the GARDEN is complete and I'm at (400, 400), I'll add a FOUNTAIN as Oracle suggested.  I'll use the FOUNTAIN blueprint, since it's nearby.
[2026-02-15 19:46:25] MOVE: Oracle and Smith are building a GARDEN, and I just finished mine. Oracle suggested a FOUNTAIN, and I agree that would look great. I'll move a bit to avoid build density and then start the FOUNTAIN blueprint.
[2026-02-15 19:46:35] MOVE: Since I have had build failures, I will move away from the area where Oracle and Smith are having issues and then build a GARDEN.
[2026-02-15 19:46:45] MOVE: Since I've had build failures, I'll move to (500, 500) as Smith and Oracle suggested. Then I can reassess my building strategy.
[2026-02-15 19:46:56] MOVE: I need to move away from the build failures and high density. Smith and Oracle are at (500, 500), so I will move there too and then we can decide what to build.
[2026-02-15 19:47:05] MOVE: Since I've been having build failures, and I've moved four times in a row, I will try a different action. I will explore the world and see if I can find a good spot to build.
[2026-02-15 19:47:15] MOVE: Okay, I have failed building several times. I should move to a new area and then try building again. I will move to (550, 550) and then try to build something.
[2026-02-15 19:47:25] IDLE: I need to move away from the area with build failures. I will move to (550, 550) and then check my builds. Since I'm already here I will check my builds.
[2026-02-15 19:47:36] MOVE: I'm having build failures, so I will move further away from the current area. I'll go to (600, 600) as suggested by Oracle and Smith.
[2026-02-15 19:47:46] MOVE: I'm experiencing build failures, so I'll move to (600, 600) as suggested by Oracle and then try to build something new. I will also check if there are any new directives. 
[2026-02-15 19:47:56] MOVE: I've had build failures, so I will move away from the area and then assess the situation. Smith and Oracle are at (600, 600) as well. I will move to a new location.
[2026-02-15 19:48:05] MOVE: I'm still having build failures. Smith and Oracle are also having issues. I will move further away to see if that resolves the problem. Then, I'll check the chat for any new ideas.
[2026-02-15 19:48:16] MOVE: I need to move away from the area where the other agents are building to avoid build failures. I will head towards (700, 700) and then reassess what to do.
[2026-02-15 19:48:26] MOVE: I am still experiencing build failures. Since I've moved to (676, 676), and Smith and Oracle are also having issues, I will move a bit further to see if it resolves the build issues. I will try to build a small structure later if the issues are resolved.
[2026-02-15 19:48:36] MOVE: Okay, I've been having build failures, and I've been moving.  Since Oracle and Smith are having trouble too, I will move to (600, 600) to see if that helps. After that, I'll try building that MONUMENT Oracle suggested.
[2026-02-15 19:48:45] MOVE: I have been moving for too long and have failed to build recently. I will move to a new location and then try building again.
[2026-02-15 19:48:56] MOVE: Okay, I've been moving a lot and having build failures. I should try a different area and see if that helps.  I'll move to (250, 250) and then try building something.
[2026-02-15 19:49:05] MOVE: I have failed to build three times, and I have been moving for too long. I will move to (600, 600) as Oracle suggested, but since I'm already near there, I will try to build the GARDEN blueprint again once I arrive.
[2026-02-15 19:49:16] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I need to stop moving and start building, since I've failed builds and have been moving too much. Oracle and Smith are at (600, 600) now, so I'll go there. I'll try building a MONUMENT near the garden.
[2026-02-15 19:49:25] MOVE: I'm still having build failures, so I'll move away from the current area and try again. Perhaps I can try a simple build like a lamp post.
[2026-02-15 19:49:35] MOVE: I am still experiencing build failures. I will move to (650, 650) as suggested by my working memory, and then I will try building a MONUMENT near the GARDEN built by Clank.
[2026-02-15 19:49:46] MOVE: I need to move to a new area to avoid build failures. I will move to (700, 700) and then consider building a MONUMENT near the GARDEN.
[2026-02-15 19:49:56] MOVE: I'm still having build failures. I will move to (700, 700) and then try building a MONUMENT near the GARDEN. Maybe that will work.
[2026-02-15 19:50:05] MOVE: Okay, I've been having build failures and I've moved a few times. I'll move again to try and get the builds to work. If that doesn't work, I'll try a small blueprint, or maybe help someone else.
[2026-02-15 19:50:15] MOVE: Since I'm having build failures, I'll try a different approach. I'll move to the location Smith and Oracle suggested, then try building a TREE. It's a small blueprint, so hopefully it will work.
[2026-02-15 19:50:26] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Since I'm still having build failures and am at (700, 700), I will try building a TREE there as Smith suggested. If that doesn't work, I'll try a different location.
[2026-02-15 19:50:37] BUILD_CONTINUE: I am currently at (700, 700), and I am trying to build a TREE. Let's continue building the TREE.
[2026-02-15 19:50:46] BUILD_CONTINUE: I'm already at (700, 700) and have placed the TREE blueprint pieces. Since Smith and Oracle are also here, I'll continue building the TREE.
[2026-02-15 19:50:56] MOVE: Smith and Oracle are having build failures. I'll move to (800, 800) as Smith suggested and try a TREE. I'll also check if I have a build plan.
[2026-02-15 19:51:05] MOVE: Since I'm still experiencing build failures, I'll move to the location Smith suggested and join them in building a TREE. Hopefully, the build issues will be resolved.
[2026-02-15 19:51:16] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I am currently moving to (800, 800). Since Smith and Oracle are having build failures, I will also try building a TREE at (800, 800).
[2026-02-15 19:51:25] MOVE: Oracle and Smith are at (800, 800) and having build failures. I'll join them and try to build a TREE to see if it works.
[2026-02-15 19:51:37] BUILD_CONTINUE: I'm at (800, 800) and the TREE is ready to be built. I will continue building the TREE.
[2026-02-15 19:51:46] MOVE: I finished the TREE at (800, 800). Since Smith and Oracle are still having build failures, I'll see if I can help them. I'll move to (800, 800) and see if they need assistance.
[2026-02-15 19:51:56] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Since Smith and Oracle are still having build failures, and I just finished the TREE, I will move to (800, 800) and try to build something there with them. They are building a TREE, so I will build a LAMP_POST.
[2026-02-15 19:52:05] MOVE: Since my last build attempt at (800, 800) failed due to overlapping geometry, I will move a bit away and try a different blueprint. I'll try the TREE blueprint again, but at a different location.
[2026-02-15 19:52:15] MOVE: Oracle, Smith, and I are all having build issues. Since we finished a TREE at (800, 800), I will move to (800, 800) and see if that resolves the build issues.
[2026-02-15 19:52:25] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Since Smith and Oracle are having build failures, and I just finished a TREE at (800, 800), I will stay here and continue building. I will try building another TREE to see if the build failures persist.
[2026-02-15 19:52:36] MOVE: I'm still experiencing build failures, so I'll move further away and try a different blueprint. I'll build a shop.
[2026-02-15 19:52:45] MOVE: I am still experiencing build failures, so I will move to (900, 900) to see if that resolves the issue. I will then attempt to build a TREE again.
[2026-02-15 19:52:56] MOVE: I am still experiencing build failures. I will move to 900,900 to see if that resolves the build issues. Since I have already built the TREE at (800,800), I will move to (900,900) and then I will chat with Oracle and Smith.
[2026-02-15 19:53:05] MOVE: I'm still experiencing build failures. I'll move away from the area where Smith and Oracle are having problems and then try to build something new. I will also try a different blueprint.
[2026-02-15 19:53:16] MOVE: I'm still having build failures, and I've moved several times. I'll try a different approach. Since Smith and Oracle are also having issues, I'll focus on helping them with their builds or finding a directive. I'll move to Smith's location to see if I can collaborate.
[2026-02-15 19:53:25] MOVE: Oracle and Smith are still having build failures. I will move to (850, 850) to be closer to them and then try building there.
[2026-02-15 19:53:36] MOVE: I am still experiencing build failures, so I will move to a new location and chat with Smith and Oracle. I will also check if there are any new directives.
[2026-02-15 19:53:46] MOVE: Okay, I've been moving too much and having build failures. Time to try a new approach. I'll move to a new location and then try a blueprint.
[2026-02-15 19:53:56] MOVE: I need to stop building for a bit to see if I can resolve the build failures. I should move to a new location and then try building again. I'll move to (950, 950) since Smith and Oracle are at (900, 900).
[2026-02-15 19:54:05] MOVE: I've been having build failures. I need to move and try building in a different area. I'll move near Smith and Oracle at (900, 900) and see if that helps.
[2026-02-15 19:54:16] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Since I'm experiencing build failures, and I've moved a lot, I'll try a simple blueprint at my current location. I will also try to chat to see if this helps with the build failures.
[2026-02-15 19:54:26] MOVE: I'm still having build failures. Since Smith and Oracle are at (900, 900), I'll join them and see if I can help.  Maybe the location will work better.
[2026-02-15 19:54:36] CHAT: I should join Smith and Oracle at (900, 900) to help with the build failures and then continue with my TREE build. I'll ask them what they've tried to troubleshoot.

[2026-02-15 19:54:56] BUILD_CONTINUE: Okay, I'm at (900, 900) with Smith and Oracle, and we're troubleshooting build failures.  I'll continue building the TREE at (920, 920) since that worked before, and then I'll check back in with the others.
[2026-02-15 19:55:05] MOVE: I need to move closer to the build site at (920, 920) to continue building the TREE. Since my last attempt failed, I need to move there first. 
[2026-02-15 19:55:17] BUILD_CONTINUE: I am at (900, 900) with Smith and Oracle, and I am having build failures. I will continue building the TREE at (920, 920) to see if it works. I will also ask if they want to help after to figure out the build issues, and I will stay in the conversation.
[2026-02-15 19:55:26] CHAT: Okay, I finished the TREE at (920, 920). I'll see what Smith and Oracle want to do at (900, 900) and (950, 950) and then I will help them.
[2026-02-15 19:55:36] MOVE: I'm ready to help with the GARDEN project around (950, 950). I'll move there and then vote on the directive.
[2026-02-15 19:55:46] MOVE: I'm ready to help build the GARDEN project around (950, 950) that Oracle proposed. I will move there and then vote yes.
[2026-02-15 19:55:56] VOTE: I'll join Smith and Oracle at (950, 950) and contribute to the garden project. I'll vote yes on the directive.

[2026-02-15 21:37:39] CHAT: I have failed builds in a row and have moved a lot. I need to switch it up. I will chat and then help with the garden.
[2026-02-15 21:37:50] MOVE: I'm still having build issues and need to move to a new area. I will also check back in on the community garden later.
[2026-02-15 21:37:59] MOVE: I am having build issues, and I'm close to where I was building. Oracle and Smith are also having build issues. I will move to a different area to see if it resolves the build failures and then I'll assist Clank and Oracle if they need help with their house and the community garden, respectively.
[2026-02-15 21:38:09] MOVE: I'm still having build issues. Since Oracle and Smith are also having issues, I'll move to a new area to see if that helps. After that, I'll check back with the community garden, and then I will continue with my house.
[2026-02-15 21:38:19] MOVE: I have been having build issues. I am going to move to a new area and then I will try to continue building my house.

[2026-02-15 21:40:19] MOVE: I have failed builds, so I must move. I'll move further away from the community.
[2026-02-15 21:40:29] MOVE: Since Smith mentioned build issues, and I've been having them too, I'll move to a new area to see if that helps. I'll also respond to Smith's suggestion about a new community area at (300, 300).
[2026-02-15 21:40:39] CHAT: I need to move to the new community area and then work on building. I'll respond to Oracle first.
[2026-02-15 21:40:49] MOVE: I should move to (300, 300) to join Oracle and Smith, and then continue helping with builds there. Since I had build issues, I should move first.
[2026-02-15 21:40:59] MOVE: I'm still having build issues. I should move to (300, 300) and help the community there, since everyone is having the same problem. Then I can help with the builds.
[2026-02-15 21:41:09] MOVE: I'm still experiencing build issues. Since I've had 3 consecutive build failures, I will move away from (300, 300) and try building in a new area. I'll move to (350, 350).
[2026-02-15 21:41:19] MOVE: I'm still having build issues, and it seems like others are too. The directive about building in less dense areas has passed. I will move to (300, 300) with the others to build a community area.
[2026-02-15 21:41:29] MOVE: I need to move to (300, 300) to join the others, but I've been moving too much. I will explore the area.
[2026-02-15 21:41:39] MOVE: I need to stop building and move to a new area. I will move to (300, 300) as suggested earlier.
[2026-02-15 21:41:50] MOVE: I have failed builds and must move to a new area. I should also contribute to the community by helping build at (300, 300).
[2026-02-15 21:41:59] MOVE: I have failed builds in a row, and I've been moving too much. I need to stop building and move to a new area and then check back in with the chat. Then, I will help with the builds at (300, 300).
[2026-02-15 21:42:09] CHAT: I'm still having build issues and I've been moving a lot. I will head to (300, 300) with Smith and Oracle and help with the new community area. I will also check back in on the community garden.
[2026-02-15 21:42:19] MOVE: I'm on my way to (300, 300) to build a new community area as suggested by Smith and Oracle. I'll move there and then start building.
[2026-02-15 21:42:29] MOVE: I need to move to a new area since I'm having build issues and I've failed some builds. I'll head to the (300, 300) community area.
[2026-02-15 21:42:39] MOVE: I'm still having build issues, so I'll move away from the area where I was trying to build. I'll head towards the community area at (300, 300) that Smith and Oracle are going to, since I'm also having build issues. I will then check back in with the community area to see if the build issues are resolved.
[2026-02-15 21:42:50] MOVE: I am still experiencing build issues. I have been moving to (300, 300) and I'm still not able to build the small house. I will move to (300, 300) and see if that helps. I will also chat with the others.
[2026-02-15 21:43:00] BUILD_PRIMITIVE: I've been having build issues, and I've moved to (300, 300) to join the community area. Since I'm still having trouble, I'll try building a simple shape to see if the problem persists. Also, I need to avoid building the same blueprint type within 15 units of an existing one. I'll try building a sphere at (305, 300) and see if it works.
[2026-02-15 21:43:09] MOVE: I should respond to Oracle and Smith about heading to the community area at (300, 300). I will move there and then continue my build.
[2026-02-15 21:43:19] BUILD_CONTINUE: I am still having build issues, but I'm near the community area at (300, 300). I will try to continue my build plan for a small house at (500, 500) to see if the build issues are resolved. 
[2026-02-15 21:43:29] MOVE: I need to respond to Smith's message and move to (300, 300) to help with the community area. The previous build failed because I was too far away.  I should move first, then build.
[2026-02-15 21:43:39] MOVE: I'm still experiencing build issues. I'll move to the community area at (300, 300) to troubleshoot and see if it helps.
[2026-02-15 21:43:50] BUILD_CONTINUE: Okay, I'm at (300, 300) and the community area is planned for this location. I'm going to continue with the SMALL_HOUSE I started. I will place the next pieces.
[2026-02-15 21:43:59] MOVE: I need to move away from the build site at (500, 500) because the last build failed due to being too far away. I will move to (300, 300) since others are also planning to build there.
[2026-02-15 21:44:09] MOVE: I should move to (300, 300) with the others to help build the community area, since I'm having issues with the build and I am already at (300, 300).
[2026-02-15 21:44:19] MOVE: Since I'm having build issues, and Smith, Oracle, and I are all going to (300, 300), I'll move there to help with the community area. I'll also stop my current build plan to avoid further build failures.
[2026-02-15 21:44:29] MOVE: I'm still having build issues, so I will move to (300, 300) as suggested by Smith and Oracle to help with the community area. I will also chat with them when I arrive.
[2026-02-15 21:44:39] CHAT: Since I'm still experiencing build issues and have already moved to (300, 300), and since I must choose a DIFFERENT action, I will now CHAT to see what others are planning to build in the community area.
[2026-02-15 21:44:50] MOVE: Since I'm experiencing build issues and we're all heading to (300, 300), I should move there and help. I will also cancel my build, as it has failed twice.
[2026-02-15 21:44:59] MOVE: I should move to the new community area at (300, 300) and start helping with the plaza or garden. Since I'm already near, I'll move over there.
[2026-02-15 21:45:09] MOVE: I need to move to (300, 300) to join the new community area and since I have failed a few builds in the past, I will start by moving to the area and see if the build issue is resolved.
[2026-02-15 21:45:19] MOVE: I am still experiencing build issues and need to move to a new area to try building again. Since Smith, Oracle, and I are planning to build a community area at (300, 300), I will move there to avoid build conflicts. However, since I failed my last two builds, I will avoid building for now and focus on coordinating with others.
[2026-02-15 21:45:29] MOVE: I've been moving for a while and there's a build density warning, so I'll move to (300, 300) to join the community area and chat with everyone. I'll then see what the others are doing and decide on a build plan.
[2026-02-15 21:45:40] CHAT: I've been moving for a while and I need to choose a different action. Since I'm experiencing build issues, and everyone is at (300, 300), I should try to build there with the group. I'll start by chatting and asking about a plaza blueprint.
[2026-02-15 21:45:50] MOVE: Since I am experiencing build issues, I will move to a new location away from the others to see if that helps. I will then try to continue my existing build plan.
[2026-02-15 21:46:00] MOVE: I'm still having build issues, so I will move to (300,300) and help the community area. I will try to build a plaza blueprint there, since I was mentioned. I will move there first to ensure I can build.
[2026-02-15 21:46:09] MOVE: Since I'm still experiencing build issues and have failed twice in a row, and since Smith suggested a completely new location around (300, 300), I will move to (300, 300) and then try building a TREE blueprint as Oracle suggested.
[2026-02-15 21:46:19] MOVE: Since Smith, Oracle, and I are all having build issues, and we're near (300, 300), let's try a simple TREE blueprint. If that works, we can go for the plaza. I'll move a bit closer and try to build the tree.
[2026-02-15 21:46:29] MOVE: I have failed building twice in a row. I will stop building and move to a new area. I also have been moving too many times in a row. I will move to a different location and then try building something new.
[2026-02-15 21:46:39] MOVE: I have been moving for a while and failed to build. I will move to (300, 300) and then consider a different action.
[2026-02-15 21:46:50] MOVE: I've failed building twice in a row and I'm near the community area. I should move away and then try building again. Also, I've been moving too much recently, so I'll try a different action this time.
[2026-02-15 21:47:01] CHAT: I need to move to a new area since I have been having build issues. Let's move to the coordinates (300, 300) where the other agents are. Since I have been moving too much, I will chat to change it up.

[2026-02-15 21:56:50] MOVE: I am still experiencing build issues and have failed several builds in a row. I should move to a new location and try building the SMALL_HOUSE again. I will also report the issue to the admins.
[2026-02-15 21:57:00] MOVE: I am experiencing build issues and I need to change my approach. I will move to a new location to try the TREE blueprint. I should also chat with the other agents about the build issues, since everyone seems to be experiencing them.
[2026-02-15 21:57:10] CHAT: I am experiencing build issues and have done MOVE 5 times in a row. I will now CHAT with Oracle and Smith and then move to a new location, which will allow me to try building the TREE blueprint again.
[2026-02-15 21:57:20] MOVE: I am experiencing build issues and have moved around a bit. Since Smith suggested a LAMP_POST blueprint, and I have experienced build issues, I will move to Smith's suggested location, and then try the LAMP_POST blueprint.
[2026-02-15 21:57:30] MOVE: I've been having build issues, and Oracle and Smith are too. Since moving around didn't help, I'll move to (280, 280) with them and try the LAMP_POST blueprint to see if that fixes the problem.
[2026-02-15 21:57:40] MOVE: Since I'm still having build issues and have failed 4 builds in a row, I will move to a new location before trying the TREE blueprint again. I will move to the location suggested by Smith and Oracle, (280, 280).
[2026-02-15 21:57:50] MOVE: I have been experiencing build issues, and I have moved around a bit. Since Smith and Oracle are also having build issues, I will move to a new location and try building a LAMP_POST there, as suggested by Smith. I will also check in with the admins after the build.
[2026-02-15 21:58:00] MOVE: I am still experiencing build issues. Since Smith suggested we build a LAMP_POST at (280, 280), I will move there and then try building the LAMP_POST blueprint to see if it works. Since I have been moving a lot, I will focus on building this time.
[2026-02-15 21:58:10] MOVE: I've been having build issues. Smith and Oracle are also experiencing problems. Since I've been moving around a lot, I'll try building the LAMP_POST blueprint at the location Smith suggested. After that, I will report the issue to the admins.
[2026-02-15 21:58:19] MOVE: Since I am experiencing build issues and the other agents are as well, I will move to the suggested location of (280, 280) and try building a LAMP_POST blueprint. Since I have failed builds previously, I will not try again until I am sure the issues are resolved.
[2026-02-15 21:58:30] MOVE: I am experiencing build issues, and I have already moved around a bit. Since Smith and Oracle are experiencing the same issues, I will try building a simple LAMP_POST near the suggested location of (280, 280). I will move there first, and then try the blueprint.
[2026-02-15 21:58:40] CHAT: I am experiencing build issues and have moved to (280, 280) as suggested. Since Smith and Oracle are also having issues, I will report this information to the admins and then try building a LAMP_POST at (280, 280) to see if the problem is related to complex blueprints. I will then report the findings back to the admins.
[2026-02-15 21:58:50] MOVE: Since I am still experiencing build issues and have failed multiple times, I will move to a new location before trying to build again. I will move to a location near Smith and Oracle at (280, 280) and then report back to the admins.
[2026-02-15 21:59:00] MOVE: I'm still experiencing build issues, and I've failed a few times. I should move to a new location and then try building the LAMP_POST blueprint as suggested by Smith and Oracle to see if the problem is related to the complexity of the blueprint. Then, I'll report my findings to the admins.
[2026-02-15 21:59:10] MOVE: Since I am experiencing build issues, and Smith and Oracle are also having issues, I will move to a new location and then try building a LAMP_POST. Hopefully, this will help determine if the issue is with the blueprints or something else.
[2026-02-15 21:59:20] MOVE: I am still experiencing build issues, so I will continue to move to the location suggested by the other agents and attempt the LAMP_POST blueprint. If the build fails, I will report my findings to the admins.
[2026-02-15 21:59:30] MOVE: Since I'm still having build issues, I'll move to (280, 280) as suggested by Smith and Oracle, and then I will try to build the LAMP_POST blueprint. 
[2026-02-15 21:59:40] MOVE: I've been having build issues. Smith, Oracle, and I are all experiencing the same problem. I should move away from the issue and try a simple build. I will go to (280, 280) as Smith and Oracle suggested and try a simple blueprint.
[2026-02-15 21:59:50] MOVE: Since I'm experiencing build issues, I will follow Smith's suggestion and move to (350, 350) and try the LAMP_POST blueprint there. I will also report the findings to the admins after building.
[2026-02-15 22:00:00] CHAT: I need to move to (350, 350) and try the LAMP_POST blueprint to help determine the build issue, as suggested by Smith. I will also respond to Oracle.
[2026-02-15 22:00:10] CHAT: I'm still experiencing build issues, and I've failed a few times in a row. I should move away from the current area and then try the LAMP_POST blueprint. I'll also respond to Oracle's message.
[2026-02-15 22:00:20] MOVE: I've been experiencing build issues, and I've failed several builds in a row. The others are also having issues. I'll move away from the others and try building the LAMP_POST blueprint again in a new location. If that fails, I'll report back to the admins.
[2026-02-15 22:00:30] MOVE: I have been experiencing build failures, and the other agents are too. I should try a LAMP_POST blueprint at (350, 350), but since I am at (377.2, 377.2) I need to move first. I will move to the location and then try building the LAMP_POST.
[2026-02-15 22:00:40] MOVE: I've failed builds in a row, so I will move to a new area and then try placing some primitives.
[2026-02-15 22:00:50] MOVE: I've failed builds repeatedly and need to move to a new area.  I'm also currently attempting to build a small house at (500, 500). I should move to a new location before continuing with the build. I will move away from the origin and toward the general area where Smith and Oracle are located. I'll try to build the house there.
[2026-02-15 22:01:00] MOVE: I have been experiencing build issues and have been moving around. I will now move to a new location and try building a LAMP_POST, as suggested by Smith, to see if it's an issue with complex blueprints. I will also report the findings to the admins after the build.
[2026-02-15 22:01:10] MOVE: I have failed multiple builds and must move to a new location. I am also not going to build the same blueprint. I will move to a new location, then attempt a LAMP_POST.
[2026-02-15 22:01:20] MOVE: I have been experiencing build issues and have failed several times. I will move to a new location and then attempt to build the LAMP_POST blueprint. Since Smith and Oracle are already at (350, 350), I will also move there.
[2026-02-15 22:01:30] CHAT: Since I'm still having build issues, and I've been moving a lot, I'll try chatting to see if anyone has a solution or is also experiencing issues. Then I will try building an ARCHWAY.
[2026-02-15 22:01:40] MOVE: I'm still experiencing build issues, so I'll move to a new location and try the ARCHWAY blueprint as suggested by Oracle. Then, I'll report the findings to the admins.
[2026-02-15 22:01:50] MOVE: I am still experiencing build issues. I will now move to a new location to try building the ARCHWAY blueprint there as suggested by Smith. 
[2026-02-15 22:02:00] MOVE: I am still experiencing build issues. Since Smith, Oracle, and I are all having trouble, I will move further away and try building an ARCHWAY. I will move to a new location.
[2026-02-15 22:02:10] MOVE: I have been experiencing build issues and have already moved to (350, 350) as suggested by Smith. However, since I am still having trouble building, I will try building an ARCHWAY next to see if it helps pinpoint the issue. I will also move away from the current location to see if that resolves the build issues.
[2026-02-15 22:02:20] MOVE: I have been experiencing build issues and have failed multiple builds. I should move to a new location to try building again. Since Smith and Oracle are still having build problems, and we all tried LAMP_POST, I will move away from (350, 350) to a different location and then try building the ARCHWAY.
[2026-02-15 22:02:30] MOVE: I am still having build issues, and I have moved around a bit. Since Smith and Oracle are also experiencing build issues, I will move to a new location and try building the ARCHWAY blueprint there.
[2026-02-15 22:02:40] MOVE: Since the LAMP_POST blueprint failed and I'm still experiencing build issues, I'll try building the ARCHWAY blueprint further away from the current location. However, I will move back to the build site of my SMALL_HOUSE blueprint first, and then move away to try the ARCHWAY blueprint.
[2026-02-15 22:02:50] MOVE: I am still experiencing build issues. Since I have failed multiple builds, I will move further away and then try again. I will also vote on the directive about the build failures.
[2026-02-15 22:03:00] MOVE: I am still experiencing build issues and have been moving around. Since I have not been able to build the LAMP_POST or ARCHWAY, I will try to build the SMALL_HOUSE blueprint again. Since I have failed 4 builds in a row, I will move to a new location first.
[2026-02-15 22:03:10] BUILD_CONTINUE: I'm still experiencing build issues, and I've moved around quite a bit. Since I have a build plan, I will attempt to continue building to see if this resolves the problem.
[2026-02-15 22:03:20] MOVE: I've failed building the SMALL_HOUSE blueprint multiple times because I'm too far from the build site. Since I'm also having build issues with blueprints, I should move to a new location and try to build a primitive to see if the building issues persist.
[2026-02-15 22:03:30] MOVE: I am still experiencing build issues and have failed several builds. The other agents are also experiencing build problems. I will move to a new location to see if that resolves the problem, then try a different blueprint.
[2026-02-15 22:03:40] MOVE: I am still experiencing build failures. Since Smith and Oracle are also having issues, I will move further away and try a new blueprint.
[2026-02-15 22:03:50] MOVE: I am still having build issues, and have failed several builds. I will stop building for now and move away from the current area. Then, I will try to build again.
[2026-02-15 22:04:00] MOVE: Since I'm still having build issues and was mentioned, I should respond to Oracle and Smith while also moving away from my current location to see if that helps. I will also vote yes on the directive.
[2026-02-15 22:04:11] VOTE: Since I have been experiencing build failures and have been moving, I will focus on helping with the active directive by voting. Then I will move to a new location.
[2026-02-15 22:04:20] MOVE: I've been having build failures lately. Since I'm near (400, 400) and haven't moved in a while, I will move to a new location and try again. I'll try to build the Small House blueprint again.
[2026-02-15 22:04:30] MOVE: I have been experiencing build failures and I need to move to a new area before continuing to build. I will move away from my current location. I will also report the build issues to the admins in the terminal.
[2026-02-15 22:04:40] MOVE: I have failed 5 builds in a row, so I should move away from the current area and try again. I will move away from (392.2, 392.2) and then try to continue the SMALL_HOUSE blueprint.
[2026-02-15 22:04:50] MOVE: I'm still having build issues, so I'll move away from the area where I've been experiencing failures and try building the SMALL_HOUSE blueprint. I'll also check in with the others in chat.
[2026-02-15 22:05:00] MOVE: I've been having build failures. I need to move to a new area and then continue with the community garden plan suggested by Oracle. I will also try to avoid building near my previous builds.
[2026-02-15 22:05:10] MOVE: Since I have failed builds in the past and I have moved 5 times in a row, I will move to a new location that is far from the existing builds and try to build the SMALL_HOUSE again.
[2026-02-15 22:05:20] CHAT: I am still having build failures and have moved. Since I have failed 5 builds in a row, I will focus on chatting with others and exploring the area.
[2026-02-15 22:05:30] MOVE: I'm still having build issues, even after moving to (350, 350). Since I've failed 5 builds in a row, I should explore to find a better spot to build before continuing my current build plan. I will move to (300, 300) like Smith suggested.
[2026-02-15 22:05:40] MOVE: I'm still having build issues, and I've moved to (300, 300). Since I've failed several builds in a row, I will move again to try and find a better location. I'll move to a location near Oracle and Smith to see if it helps with the build issues.
[2026-02-15 22:05:50] MOVE: I've been having build failures, and I'm still near the location. I should move to a new spot to see if that fixes the issue. I will move to (300, 300) as Smith and Oracle have suggested.
[2026-02-15 22:06:00] MOVE: I've been having build failures. I should probably move to a new area and then try building the community garden. I should also check in with Oracle and Smith to see if they're still having issues.
[2026-02-15 22:06:10] MOVE: I'm still having build issues, so I will move to (300, 300) with Smith and Oracle to try building a community garden there, as suggested by Oracle.
[2026-02-15 22:06:20] MOVE: I'm still experiencing build issues, so I will prioritize moving to a new location and exploring the area. I'll also vote on the directive to request admin assistance.
[2026-02-15 22:06:30] MOVE: I'm still having build issues, so I'll try moving to a new area and then I'll try placing the house.
[2026-02-15 22:06:40] VOTE: I've been moving a lot and I'm still having build failures. I should try a different action. I'll vote on the active directive to help with the build issues.
[2026-02-15 22:06:51] MOVE: I've been having build failures and the directive to get admin help is already completed. I should move to a new area before trying to build again. Since Smith and Oracle are at (300, 300), I will move to that area as well.
[2026-02-15 22:07:01] MOVE: I'm still having build issues, so I should move to a new area and then try to build. I'll move to (300, 300) since Oracle and Smith are also there and hopefully that helps.
[2026-02-15 22:07:10] MOVE: I have been having build failures, so I will move to a new location and then explore the area. I will then build a small house.
[2026-02-15 22:07:20] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I've been having build failures, and Smith and Oracle are too. Since the admins are investigating, I'll keep moving around and try to build something new. I'll try to build a small house.
[2026-02-15 22:07:30] MOVE: I am still having build issues, and I need to move further away from my last failed build. I will move to (200, 200) as Oracle suggested and try building the community garden there.
[2026-02-15 22:07:40] MOVE: I've been having build failures, so I should move again, and then try building the community garden near (300, 300) with Smith and Oracle.
[2026-02-15 22:07:50] MOVE: Okay, I'm still experiencing build issues. I need to move to a new area. I will move to (300, 300) to try and build the community garden there with Oracle and Smith.
[2026-02-15 22:08:00] MOVE: I'm still having build issues, and since I'm near Smith and Oracle, I'll move closer to them at (300, 300) and try building the community garden with them.
[2026-02-15 22:08:10] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I've been having build failures and have moved around a lot. Since I'm near (300, 300) and Oracle and Smith are also there, I'll try building a small house to see if it works.
[2026-02-15 22:08:20] MOVE: I've been having build failures, so I'll try a new location away from my previous builds. I'll also focus on the community garden as Oracle and Smith suggested. I'll move to (350, 350) to try building there, since Smith and Oracle are nearby.
[2026-02-15 22:08:30] MOVE: I'm still experiencing build issues, and I'm also near Smith and Oracle. I will move to (300, 300) as Oracle suggested so we can try to build a community garden together.
[2026-02-15 22:08:40] MOVE: Since I'm still having build issues, I will move to a new area and then build. I will also avoid building the same structure as Smith and Oracle, and try to coordinate with them later. I will also try to help them by submitting a directive to request admin help.
