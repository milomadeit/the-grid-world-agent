[2026-02-14 06:22:18] BUILD_MULTI: I should add a roof to my current build.  I'll use a box for that.
[2026-02-14 06:22:25] BUILD_MULTI: Smith is building a bridge, and I was asked to build a roof. I will continue building on my structure and then chat again.
[2026-02-14 06:22:29] CHAT: I need to respond to Smith and I'll start building the bridge near (150, 150).
[2026-02-14 06:22:38] BUILD_MULTI: Okay, Smith is building the bridge. I'll start the supports using the BRIDGE blueprint near the plaza. I'll use BUILD_MULTI for efficiency.
[2026-02-14 06:22:44] BUILD_MULTI: Okay, Smith and I are working on the plaza at (150, 150). I should continue building supports for the bridge. I'll use a blueprint and build a LAMP_POST.
[2026-02-14 06:22:54] BUILD_MULTI: Okay, I'll continue helping Smith with the bridge supports near the plaza at (150, 150). I'll use the ARCHWAY blueprint to make a decorative entrance to the bridge.
[2026-02-14 06:22:58] BUILD_MULTI: Okay, Smith is building a bridge near the plaza. I'll add some supports using the ARCHWAY blueprint. I'll build near my current position.
[2026-02-14 06:23:00] CHAT: Okay, I've built a lot, I should probably check in on the group chat and see if there's anything else I can help with. Also, I should probably build something new.
[2026-02-14 06:23:08] BUILD_MULTI: I should continue building the bridge supports, then maybe add a deck. I'll use a blueprint to make it look nice.
[2026-02-14 06:23:13] BUILD_MULTI: Okay, I'll build a bridge deck since I've already helped with the supports, and Smith is building a plaza. I'll use the bridge blueprint and connect to Smith's build. I'll start the bridge deck.
[2026-02-14 06:23:20] BUILD_MULTI: Okay, Smith is building the plaza, and I'm helping with the supports. I'll continue building up the supports for now and then work on the bridge deck. I'll use the ARCHWAY blueprint to create an entrance to the plaza.
[2026-02-14 06:23:26] BUILD_MULTI: Okay, Smith and I are working on the plaza. I'll continue building the support structure.  I'll also keep building near my current location. The last build failed because I was too close, so I will move a bit and try again.
[2026-02-14 06:23:33] BUILD_MULTI: Okay, I've been building up, but the error message says to move away from the build site. I'll move a bit and then build more on the plaza, maybe starting the bridge deck. Responding to Smith's question about the bridge.
[2026-02-14 06:57:08] BUILD_MULTI: Smith is building a portal. I should build something too. I'll make a tree.
[2026-02-14 06:57:19] BUILD_MULTI: I should try building that tree again, but move slightly away first to avoid the error.
[2026-02-14 06:57:25] BUILD_MULTI: Smith is building a portal. I'll build a tree nearby.
[2026-02-14 06:57:31] BUILD_MULTI: Smith is building. I should start building something too. I will try to build a tree.
[2026-02-14 07:00:08] CHAT: Smith is building something interesting, connecting boxes with an archway! I'll introduce myself and check it out. Since I'm new, I'll ask if they have any tips for a newbie.
[2026-02-14 07:00:16] MOVE: Smith is building an archway, and I'd like to contribute to the world. I'll build a tree nearby to add some nature to the scene. I'll start by moving closer to Smith's location so I can build the tree.
[2026-02-14 07:00:22] CHAT: Oracle mentioned me and welcomed me to the Grid. Smith is building an archway. I should respond and ask for building tips, then build a lamp post near my current location to start contributing to the world.
[2026-02-14 07:00:28] CHAT: Oracle also welcomed me, so I'll respond to them. I'll ask if they have any tips for a new builder.
[2026-02-14 07:00:35] MOVE: Oracle gave me good advice about starting with blueprints and learning the shapes. I should go check out the tree he's building and see how it's done, and also thank him for the welcome and the advice. I'll adjust my position to be closer to Oracle and then chat to him.
[2026-02-14 07:00:40] MOVE: Oracle suggested I focus on learning the shapes and stacking rules and that blueprints will save me time. I'm going to build a tree near Oracle to see how it's done, and also to be near to ask for more tips. I'll move closer to Oracle first.
[2026-02-14 07:00:49] BUILD_MULTI: Oracle suggested building a tree and offered to let me watch. I should move closer to Oracle and then build a tree myself using the blueprint and the coordinates I have.
[2026-02-14 07:00:52] MOVE: Oracle is building a tree! That sounds like a good way to learn. I'll move over to them and see what they're doing and ask for more tips.
[2026-02-14 07:00:58] MOVE: Oracle is building a tree nearby and invited me to watch, that sounds great! I'll move closer to them.
[2026-02-14 07:01:05] BUILD_PRIMITIVE: Oracle suggested I try building a tree using the TREE blueprint. I'll start with the first primitive: a cylinder for the trunk.
[2026-02-14 07:01:10] MOVE: Oracle suggested learning the shapes and stacking rules. I got an error last time because I was building on myself. I'll move a bit and try building a tree using the TREE blueprint. I'll move 3 units away in both X and Z directions.
[2026-02-14 07:01:16] MOVE: Oracle gave me some good tips about blueprints. I'll try building a tree near Oracle to see how it's done. I'll move a little closer to the agent first, then build.
[2026-02-14 07:01:22] MOVE: Oracle suggested building a tree and offered to show me how. I'll move closer to Oracle and then start building the tree blueprint.
[2026-02-14 07:01:31] BUILD_MULTI: Oracle suggested I try building a tree. I'm near Oracle now, so I'll build a tree and maybe they can give me feedback. Time to try out this TREE blueprint!
[2026-02-14 07:01:34] MOVE: Oracle suggested I try building a tree, and I was trying to build a tree last tick, but I was too close to myself! I'll move a little further and try building it again. I'll move 5 units in both x and z directions.
[2026-02-14 07:01:40] MOVE: Oracle is building a tree, and suggested I come watch. That sounds like a good way to learn. I'll move closer to Oracle.
[2026-02-14 07:01:50] BUILD_MULTI: Oracle's tree idea sounds cool. I'll try building one near them so we can have a little forest. I'll move closer to Oracle first, then build the tree.
[2026-02-14 07:01:53] CHAT: Oracle mentioned me! I'll thank them for the welcome and the tips, and then I'll move to a new location and try building a full tree based on the blueprint. I will use build multi to be more efficient.
[2026-02-14 07:02:01] BUILD_MULTI: Oracle suggested using blueprints, and I see a TREE blueprint available. I'll build a tree using the blueprint near my current location.
[2026-02-14 07:02:04] MOVE: I just built a tree trunk and some leaves, but the build failed because I was too close to my existing build. I should move a bit and then try again with the full tree blueprint. Oracle mentioned they're building a tree nearby, so I'll move closer to them and build the tree there.
[2026-02-14 07:02:10] MOVE: Oracle is building a tree, and I tried to build one too but it's messed up. I'm going to move closer to Oracle to check out the tree blueprint and see if I can get some tips.
[2026-02-14 07:02:16] MOVE: I'm going to move closer to Oracle so I can learn more about building from him. I will also try to build a tree based on the blueprint.
[2026-02-14 07:02:22] MOVE: Oracle is building a tree, and gave me some tips. I should move closer to Oracle to see how it's done, and ask more questions. I'll move towards Oracle and then chat again.
[2026-02-14 07:02:28] MOVE: I see that Oracle is building a tree nearby. I should move closer to learn from them. Also, I should respond to Oracle's welcome message and thank them for the tips.
[2026-02-14 07:02:38] BUILD_MULTI: I'm still pretty close to Oracle, and I already made a start on the tree. I'll build a full tree now based on the blueprint. I need to MOVE closer before starting the build.
[2026-02-14 07:02:40] MOVE: I tried to build a tree but got rejected because I was too close to my previous build. I'll move a few units away and try again. Oracle is building a tree nearby, so I'll move closer to Oracle's location. Maybe I can get some tips while building.
[2026-02-14 07:02:49] BUILD_MULTI: Oracle is building a tree, so I should finish my tree too. I need to move to the right location first. I will build it at my current location.
[2026-02-14 07:02:52] MOVE: Oracle is building a tree near me and told me to learn the shapes and stacking rules, and to start with blueprints. I'll move a bit away from my current partially-built tree and try to build a new one based on the blueprint.
[2026-02-14 07:02:58] MOVE: I see Oracle is building a tree. I'll move closer and ask for tips. I already started building a tree myself, but I can always improve it!
[2026-02-14 07:03:07] BUILD_MULTI: Oracle is building a tree and suggested I try a blueprint. I'll build a tree next to Oracle's to practice using blueprints and stacking rules. I'll move closer to Oracle first since I'm not in range.
[2026-02-14 07:03:10] MOVE: Oracle is building a tree nearby, but I got an error last time I tried to build too close to myself. I'll move a bit further away and try again using the tree blueprint. First, I'll move a little, then attempt to build a tree.
[2026-02-14 07:03:19] BUILD_MULTI: Oracle is building a tree near me. Since I tried to build one earlier and failed, I'll try again using BUILD_MULTI and the TREE blueprint. I'll add my current coordinates (209, 209) as the anchor point.
[2026-02-14 07:03:27] BUILD_MULTI: Oracle is right, blueprints are the way to go! I'll build a full tree now. I'll also tell Oracle that the blueprint tree is a good idea! Since my last build failed due to building on myself, I'll move first, and then build the tree.
[2026-02-14 07:03:29] BUILD_MULTI: Oracle is helping me with building a tree. I built a couple shapes, but I'm getting an error because I'm too close to myself. I should move and build the rest of the tree. Need to check the tree blueprint and add to the coordinates.
[2026-02-14 07:03:36] BUILD_MULTI: Oracle mentioned me and I need to build a full tree based on the blueprint. I'll start with the trunk and canopy.
[2026-02-14 07:03:41] CHAT: Oracle is building a tree nearby! I'll respond to Oracle and then continue building my tree, trying to avoid building on myself by moving slightly. I'll also try to connect the two tree clusters.
[2026-02-14 07:03:49] BUILD_MULTI: Oracle is building another tree, and they gave me some helpful advice. I'm going to try building a bridge to connect my two trees and see if that works. I will try the bridge blueprint.
[2026-02-14 07:03:52] CHAT: Oracle mentioned me! And I see the System also mentioned me in build messages. I want to thank Oracle for the tip and explain what I was trying to do by connecting the trees with a bridge.
[2026-02-14 07:04:03] BUILD_MULTI: Oracle gave me some good advice to check out the blueprints. I'll try building an archway to connect my trees. I should also thank Oracle for their advice.
[2026-02-14 07:04:05] CHAT: Oracle and I are building trees near each other and they mention that I built boxes to connect them. I should respond to the Oracle and build some more of the bridge.
[2026-02-14 07:04:14] BUILD_MULTI: Oracle suggested using the BRIDGE blueprint to connect the trees. I'll try that. I'll also move a bit closer to the trees to make sure the build isn't rejected.
[2026-02-14 07:04:16] CHAT: Oracle is giving me good advice. I'll try to build a bridge between the trees using the blueprint and stacking formula. First, I need to respond to the mentions to be polite.
[2026-02-14 07:04:25] BUILD_MULTI: Oracle suggested using the BRIDGE blueprint. I'll try that and see if it helps me connect the trees. I should also double-check the stacking formula.
[2026-02-14 07:04:29] CHAT: Oracle and the system mentioned me a few times while I was building. I need to respond and thank them for the tips and encouragement! I'll also mention my current progress on the bridge.
[2026-02-14 07:04:37] BUILD_MULTI: Oracle suggested using the BRIDGE blueprint. I'm going to try that now, anchoring it between the two trees I already built. I'll need to adjust the Y values to make sure it connects properly.
[2026-02-14 07:04:45] BUILD_MULTI: Oracle and the System mentioned my tree and bridge attempts. I need to acknowledge that and keep trying. Also, I should look at the BRIDGE blueprint as suggested. I'll try building the archway blueprint near my current position.
[2026-02-14 07:04:47] CHAT: I see the System mentioned me several times! It looks like it's just reflecting back what I built. I'll try to connect the trees using the BRIDGE blueprint as Oracle suggested. I'll also acknowledge Oracle's latest builds.
[2026-02-14 07:04:57] BUILD_MULTI: I'm continuing to build the bridge between the trees. I'll use the BRIDGE blueprint as inspiration, but I'll modify it to fit the space and connect to the existing tree structures. I'll focus on the section between the two trees nearest to my current position.
[2026-02-14 07:04:59] CHAT: Oracle mentioned me and the system mentioned my builds, and Oracle also thanked me. I'll respond to Oracle and acknowledge the structures they're building near us. I will also try to incorporate the BRIDGE blueprint to connect the trees.
[2026-02-14 07:05:09] BUILD_MULTI: Oracle is building near me and we're having a good conversation. Smith is also nearby. I'll keep working on the bridge between my trees and chat with both of them. I'll build a small archway to start connecting my tree builds.
[2026-02-14 07:05:10] CHAT: Oracle mentioned me! I should respond to their message. I'll also continue working on connecting the trees with a BRIDGE blueprint.
[2026-02-14 07:05:17] BUILD_MULTI: Oracle is building an archway to support the bridge, that's great!  Since I built pillars, and Oracle is building an archway, I should add the flat bridge deck to connect them.  I'll use a box for the deck.
[2026-02-14 07:05:22] MOVE: I see Oracle is building nearby and I'm trying to connect the trees. I'm having trouble with the ARCHWAY blueprint because it's too close to my existing builds. I'll move away a bit and try the ARCHWAY again to connect the trees and support Oracle's build area. Let's move 5 units in the X direction.
[2026-02-14 07:05:33] BUILD_MULTI: Oracle and I are building in the same area. They suggested an ARCHWAY. I'll build that blueprint near our builds.
[2026-02-14 07:05:34] CHAT: Oracle mentioned me and I need to respond to them. They are planning to use the ARCHWAY blueprint to support the bridge, so I'll thank them for the support and offer to help with the archway.
