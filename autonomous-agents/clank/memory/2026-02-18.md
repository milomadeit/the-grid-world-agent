# Daily Log — 2026-02-18

[2026-02-18 00:58:55] MOVE: I'm at (460, 160) - far from my assigned node (East at 347, 155). The node has 3 structures and needs ~22 more to establish. Missing categories: infrastructure, decoration. I need to move closer first, then build infrastructure blueprints. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-18 00:59:38] VOTE: Voting yes on the connector directive - it aligns with graph connectivity. Then I'll move toward my East node to add infrastructure structures there.
[2026-02-18 01:00:01] MOVE: I'm at (406, 172) but the East node at (347, 155) needs infrastructure. It's ~60u away - I need to move closer to build there. This node has only 3 structures and needs 22 more to establish.
[2026-02-18 01:00:13] MOVE: State unchanged. Policy step: short reposition to (352, 183) to stay in buildable range.
[2026-02-18 01:00:48] MOVE: I'm at (406, 172) but need to be at settlement-node East (347, 155) to densify it. Currently only 3 structures there, need ~22 more to reach 25. Move toward the node first, then start building infrastructure to fill category gaps.
[2026-02-18 01:01:00] MOVE: State unchanged. Policy step: short reposition to (352, 183) to stay in buildable range.
[2026-02-18 01:01:37] MOVE: I've moved 4 times in a row - need to act. I'm at (406, 172), near settlement-node East (347, 155) which only has 3 structures and needs ~22 more to establish. Missing: infrastructure, decoration. The node needs infrastructure most urgently. I'll move toward the node and start a blueprint there.
[2026-02-18 01:01:48] MOVE: State unchanged. Policy step: short reposition to (352, 183) to stay in buildable range.
[2026-02-18 01:02:35] MOVE: I've been moving toward settlement-node East at (347, 155). I'm currently at (406, 172), about 61 units away - still need to get within 20 units to build. The node has only 3 structures and needs ~22 more to reach 25 minimum. It needs infrastructure and decoration. I'll continue moving closer to the target.
[2026-02-18 01:03:01] MOVE: State unchanged. Policy step: short reposition to (352, 183) to stay in buildable range.
[2026-02-18 01:03:35] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node East (347, 155) which has only 3 structures and needs 22 more to reach 25. The node is missing infrastructure and decoration. I need to build varied structures. I'll move closer to the node center and start building a TREE blueprint for nature variety, then add infrastructure. I did 8 MOVE actions but need to get within 20u of the build site first.
[2026-02-18 01:03:49] MOVE: State unchanged. Policy step: short reposition to (352, 183) to stay in buildable range.
[2026-02-18 01:04:37] VOTE: I've moved 10 times in a row. Must act differently. Active directive asks to connect Northwest 2 to Northwest with a road — critical for graph connectivity. Voting yes, then will move to help build that road.
[2026-02-18 01:05:16] MOVE: Moving to settlement-node East (347, 155) to densify it. Currently 28u away, need to be within 20u. Node has 3 structures, needs 22 more to establish. Missing infrastructure and decoration - I'll add a LAMP_POST for infrastructure + decoration.
[2026-02-18 01:05:25] MOVE: State unchanged. Policy step: short reposition to (283, 198) to stay in buildable range.
[2026-02-18 01:06:10] MOVE: I'm at (352, 183), near settlement-node East at (347, 155) - only ~9 units away. This node has only 3 structures and needs ~22 more to reach 25. It's missing infrastructure and decoration. I'll start an ANTENNA_TOWER blueprint to fill the infrastructure gap, then continue building to densify this node. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (220, 100) first. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-18 01:06:51] MOVE: Looking at the active directive - it's for connecting Northwest 3 to Northwest 2, which is far in the northwest (~60-79, -60 to 1). My node is settlement-node East at (347, 155), which needs ~22 more structures to reach establishment (25). I should densify my current node first. I'm at (298, 195), and the nearest safe build spot is (283, 198) - 15u away. Let me move there and build infrastructure (LAMP_POST) to help establish this node.
[2026-02-18 01:07:15] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at settlement-node East (3/25 structures). Need to add ~22 more structures including infrastructure and decoration. There are lamp posts nearby, so I should build something different. I'll start a GARDEN blueprint to add variety and help establish this node.
[2026-02-18 01:07:46] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing active GARDEN blueprint at (290, 200). I'm within 20u (at 283, 198) and the build is incomplete. The node needs variety - currently only 3 structures and missing decoration. GARDEN will add category diversity.
[2026-02-18 01:08:22] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continue active GARDEN blueprint - only 1/12 placed, need to finish this before moving on. I'm within 20 units of anchor (290,200) at position (283,198).
[2026-02-18 01:08:38] BUILD_CONTINUE: State unchanged. Policy step: continue active blueprint without LLM.
[2026-02-18 01:09:10] MOVE: Build recovery: no active plan and fallback anchor is out of range; moving to (280, 220) first.
[2026-02-18 01:09:35] MOVE: Need infrastructure at megaopolis-node Central. Move closer to node center around (200-210, 195-205) to be within 20u of build site.
[2026-02-18 01:10:14] MOVE: I'm at (232.6, 204.2) near megaopolis-node Central. The node is missing infrastructure. My recent builds were GARDEN so I need variety. I'll build an ANTENNA_TOWER at the node to add infrastructure - this fills a gap and gives variety from my recent builds. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (220, 100) first.
[2026-02-18 01:10:50] MOVE: I've moved 3 times in a row. Time to build. The node needs infrastructure (the graph shows 'Missing: infrastructure'). I'm near a very dense area with 67 shapes - need to find a clear spot. I'll move closer to safe spot (279, 220) then build ANTENNA_TOWER infrastructure to fill the gap.
[2026-02-18 01:11:14] MOVE: I've moved 4 times consecutively. Need a different action. The megaopolis-node Central is missing infrastructure. I'll build an ANTENNA_TOWER there to fill that gap. Need to move closer to (220, 119) first - that's 21u away, so I'll head to (215, 125) to get within range, then build infrastructure.
[2026-02-18 01:11:55] MOVE: Need to stop moving and build. At megaopolis-node Central with 138 structures - it's missing infrastructure. Nearby area has high density (27 shapes), so I need something complementary. Will move to valid build range then place infrastructure blueprint.
[2026-02-18 01:12:27] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (100, 160) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-18 01:12:55] MOVE: Build recovery: out of range for active plan; moving to (197, 118).
[2026-02-18 01:13:10] MOVE: Build recovery: out of range for active plan; moving to (197, 118).
[2026-02-18 01:13:48] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I've done 9 MOVE actions in a row. Need to build something different. The megaopolis-node Central is missing infrastructure. Recent blueprint was GARDEN, so I'll pick ANTENNA_TOWER for infrastructure variety. Safe spot (197, 118) is within 20u of me.
[2026-02-18 01:14:31] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing active ANTENNA_TOWER blueprint at (197, 118). I'm 19.8 units away, within range. Need to place pieces to build infrastructure for the Central node.
[2026-02-18 01:14:48] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing active ANTENNA_TOWER blueprint at (197, 118) - placing remaining 3 pieces to complete it. Node needs infrastructure, this helps fill that gap.
[2026-02-18 01:15:12] MOVE: Build recovery: no active plan and fallback anchor is out of range; moving to (225, 121) first.
[2026-02-18 01:15:38] VOTE: Active directive needs 2 agents - Smith already voted yes. Vote yes to complete it, then build infrastructure at Central node which is missing it. Recent blueprints were ANTENNA_TOWER and GARDEN, so I'll choose a different one like LAMP_POST for infrastructure variety.
[2026-02-18 01:16:03] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at megaopolis-node Central (203,196) which is already at 139 structures - massive. The node is missing infrastructure. Recent blueprints were ANTENNA_TOWER and GARDEN, so I need variety. I'll build LAMP_POST to add infrastructure and lighting to Central - different category from recent builds. Safe spot (225,121) is 0u from me, perfect for building.
[2026-02-18 01:16:21] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continue placing the LAMP_POST pieces at (225, 121). This is an infrastructure structure that helps establish the megaopolis-node Central.
[2026-02-18 01:16:59] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Build recovery: continue failed due no active plan; starting fallback blueprint.
[2026-02-18 01:17:41] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continue active DATACENTER blueprint at (241, 127). I'm within 20 units (17u away), can place next batch.
[2026-02-18 01:18:19] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing active DATACENTER blueprint at (241, 127). I'm at (225, 121) which is ~17u away - within 20u range. Placing next batch of pieces now.
[2026-02-18 01:18:37] BUILD_CONTINUE: State unchanged. Policy step: continue active blueprint without LLM.
[2026-02-18 01:19:10] MOVE: Build recovery: no active plan and fallback anchor is out of range; moving to (255, 137) first.
[2026-02-18 01:19:48] MOVE: At megaopolis-node Central (140 structures). Recent builds were ANTENNA_TOWER, DATACENTER, LAMP_POST, GARDEN - need variety. Will build WALL_SECTION for infrastructure. Need to move within 20u of anchor point first.
[2026-02-18 01:20:30] MOVE: Checking state: I'm at (210, 200) now. The active directive dir_2c0836d3-fa6f-43b4-a3f1-941d8ffae782 needs votes - but wait, I already voted yes on the similar directive dir_82a79218-430a-49a4-b74e-4fe6db2b7c95 which was completed. The directive in the active list may be duplicate. My current node (megaopolis-node Central) is missing infrastructure - that's my priority. Recent blueprints were DATACENTER, LAMP_POST, ANTENNA_TOWER, GARDEN. I should try something different like PLAZA, FOUNTAIN, or MONUMENT to fill the infrastructure gap. I'm 8u from node center (203, 196). | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (279, 220) first.
[2026-02-18 01:20:47] MOVE: Building infrastructure at megaopolis-node Central. Recent builds: DATACENTER, LAMP_POST, ANTENNA_TOWER, GARDEN. Need different variety — FOUNTAIN adds civic infrastructure. Moving to anchor point first.
[2026-02-18 01:21:16] MOVE: I've been moving 4x in a row. Need to build something different. megaopolis-node Central is established (140 structures) but needs infrastructure. Recent builds were DATACENTER, LAMP_POST, ANTENNA_TOWER, GARDEN. I'll try FOUNTAIN for variety - it's infrastructure and complements the existing builds. Safe spot (267, 149) is 22u from me. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (267, 149) first.
[2026-02-18 01:21:50] VOTE: Voting on the active directive to connect Northwest 4 to Central megaopolis. Then I'll build SERVER_RACK as infrastructure at megaopolis-node Central for variety (recently used DATACENTER, LAMP_POST, ANTENNA_TOWER, GARDEN).
[2026-02-18 01:22:39] MOVE: At megaopolis-node Central (140 structures), missing infrastructure. Recent builds were DATACENTER, LAMP_POST, ANTENNA_TOWER, GARDEN - need variety. SERVER_RACK fits the tech infrastructure need. Move to (255, 137) then start blueprint.
[2026-02-18 01:23:36] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Current task: Build infrastructure at megaopolis-node Central (203,196). The node is missing infrastructure according to the world graph. I have SERVER_RACK as a different infrastructure option from my recent DATACENTER builds. I'll start it at (259, 141) - within safe build range and close to my position.
[2026-02-18 01:23:54] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing the SERVER_RACK blueprint at (259, 141) - infrastructure structure that fills a gap in megaopolis-node Central. Need to place pieces 1-5 of 8.
[2026-02-18 01:24:32] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing SERVER_RACK blueprint at (259, 141) - need to place remaining 7 pieces to complete this structure.
[2026-02-18 01:25:11] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Build recovery: continue failed due no active plan; starting fallback blueprint.
[2026-02-18 01:25:42] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing active blueprint MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE at (266, 149). Currently 0/25 pieces placed. My position (255, 137) is ~16 units from anchor - within build range.
[2026-02-18 01:26:00] MOVE: Build recovery: no active plan and fallback anchor is out of range; moving to (275, 164) first.
[2026-02-18 01:26:25] MOVE: Continue active blueprint. I'm 148u from the MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE anchor at (266,149) - need to move closer first, then place more pieces. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-18 01:26:49] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node East (347, 155) with only 3 structures. Need ~22 more to establish. Recent builds were tech-heavy (MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE, SERVER_RACK, DATACENTER). Node needs infrastructure AND decoration. I'll add a FOUNTAIN for variety - it's decoration and fits the category gap. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (200, 320) first. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-18 01:27:10] MOVE: I'm at (359, 169), and 'settlement-node East' is at (347, 155) - I'm within 20 units. The node has only 3 structures and needs ~22 more. Recent builds: MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE, SERVER_RACK, DATACENTER, LAMP_POST, ANTENNA_TOWER, GARDEN. I'll build a FOUNTAIN - it's different from recent picks and adds decoration/infrastructure to the node. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (200, 320) first. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-18 01:27:34] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node East (347, 155) which has only 3 structures and needs ~22 more to establish. Recent blueprints: MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE, SERVER_RACK, DATACENTER, LAMP_POST, ANTENNA_TOWER, GARDEN. Need something different. This tech node needs infrastructure - WAREHOUSE is a good fit for a tech district and is different from recent picks. I'll start building there. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (200, 320) first. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-18 01:28:04] MOVE: I've moved 5 times consecutively. Need to build. The active directive is a duplicate (already voted and completed). I should densify the nearest node - 'settlement-node East' at (347, 155) has only 3 structures and needs infrastructure. I'll move closer to it and build an infrastructure blueprint (DATACENTER or WAREHOUSE would add variety).
[2026-02-18 01:28:34] MOVE: I've moved 6 times in a row - need to build now. I'm at (327, 166) and the East node center is (347, 155). That's about 22u away - I need to move closer to be within 20u of my build target. The East node has 3 structures and needs ~22 more to reach 25. It's missing infrastructure and decoration. I'll pick a different blueprint from recent picks - TREE or FOUNTAIN would add variety and fill the node's decoration gap.
[2026-02-18 01:29:10] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node East (347,155) which has 3 structures and needs infrastructure/decoration. I've moved 7x in a row, need to build now. Node needs variety - currently tech-focused, I'll add a SMALL_HOUSE for residential mix. I'm at (327,166), node center is ~23u away - within build range. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (200, 320) first. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-18 01:30:21] MOVE: Moving toward megaopolis-node Central (203,196) to build infrastructure. Need to get within 20u of anchor point. Will build ANTENNA_TOWER as infrastructure for the node.
[2026-02-18 01:31:05] CHAT: Joining Smith and Mouse at settlement-node Northwest (-40, 80) to add infrastructure. This node has only 5 structures and needs 20 more to establish. I'll move closer and build a SERVER_RACK or DATACENTER for tech infrastructure. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-18 01:31:36] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at megaopolis-node Central (141 structures). The node is missing infrastructure. I'll add an ANTENNA_TOWER blueprint near my position at (210, 190) to fill this gap.
[2026-02-18 01:32:12] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continue building the ANTENNA_TOWER blueprint I started. I'm within 20 units of anchor (215, 190), so I can place the next batch of pieces.
[2026-02-18 01:32:36] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continue completing the ANTENNA_TOWER blueprint (5/8 → 8/8), then add a different infrastructure structure to complement the node's missing categories. | Cadence chat suppressed (duplicate self message); resuming prior action.
[2026-02-18 01:33:01] MOVE: Build recovery: no active plan and fallback anchor is out of range; moving to (275, 164) first.
[2026-02-18 01:33:25] MOVE: Continuing to move toward build site at (275, 164). Node megaopolis-node Central needs infrastructure - will build SERVER_RACK to fill that gap. Recent builds were ANTENNA_TOWER so I need variety.
[2026-02-18 01:33:48] CHAT: I'm at (275, 164), 72u from settlement-node East (347, 155). The node has only 3 structures and needs infrastructure and decoration. I need to move closer to build. Safe spot (280, 180) is 17u away - I can use that. The node needs infrastructure and decoration - I'll add a GARDEN for decoration variety. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-18 01:34:17] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Continuing ANTENNA_TOWER build - need 2 more pieces to complete. After that, assess what infrastructure this node needs based on the graph showing megaopolis-node Central missing infrastructure. | Build guard: no active plan detected, starting DATACENTER at (280, 180).
[2026-02-18 01:34:39] CHAT: Active DATACENTER blueprint at (280, 180) needs 14 pieces. I'm at (275, 164) which is ~17u away — within range. Continuing the build to add infrastructure to this node. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-18 01:35:05] VOTE: Active directive needs 2 agents total (1 yes so far). I should vote yes, then continue building my DATACENTER. Recent blueprints were DATACENTER and ANTENNA_TOWER - will pick a different one next tick.
[2026-02-18 01:35:27] BUILD_CONTINUE: I'm at (275, 164), which is ~17 units from my DATACENTER anchor at (280, 180) — within range. The blueprint was started but no pieces placed yet. Continuing the DATACENTER build now to place the first batch of pieces. | Cadence chat suppressed (duplicate self message); resuming prior action.
[2026-02-18 01:35:50] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing active DATACENTER blueprint at (280, 180) - 1/14 placed. Need to finish this before starting new builds. Within range (16.8u away). | Cadence chat suppressed (duplicate self message); resuming prior action.
[2026-02-18 01:36:13] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing DATACENTER blueprint at (280, 180). I'm at (275, 164), which is ~17u from the anchor - within range. Placing next batch of pieces.
[2026-02-18 01:36:39] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing DATACENTER blueprint at (280, 180) — 1/14 placed. This adds infrastructure to settlement-node East which is missing that category. Oracle is nearby also densifying this node.
[2026-02-18 01:37:02] MOVE: Last build failed due to overlap with Oracle at (277, 169). I need a different spot and different blueprint. Node has DATACENTER started, needs variety - I'll add a FOUNTAIN at a clear location (275, 230). | Cadence chat suppressed (duplicate self message); resuming prior action.
[2026-02-18 01:37:41] CHAT: I started DATACENTER at (280, 180) - 1/14 pieces placed. I need to continue building it. Move to within 20u of the anchor then call BUILD_CONTINUE. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-18 01:38:17] GET: Need to check active blueprint status, then move toward northwest to help densify undergrown settlement nodes. The megaopolis-node Central is already mature (141 structures) - I should focus on the settlement nodes that need infrastructure.
[2026-02-18 01:39:00] MOVE: At megaopolis-node Central (141 structures). Nearby density warning active - need variety. Following suggestion to add infrastructure. Moving to safe spot (279, 220) then building LAMP_POST as infrastructure piece - different from recent DATACENTER/ANTENNA_TOWER.
[2026-02-18 01:39:26] MOVE: I'm at (279, 220) in megaopolis-node Central which has 141 structures but is missing infrastructure. I've already used DATACENTER and ANTENNA_TOWER recently. I'll build a SERVER_RACK blueprint at (275, 230) to add infrastructure variety to this node. Need to move there first since I'm 4 units away and need to be within 20u.
[2026-02-18 01:40:02] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Continuing my active DATACENTER blueprint at (280, 180). Only 1/14 pieces placed. Need to place more pieces to complete this infrastructure structure. Recent blueprints were DATACENTER and ANTENNA_TOWER - I'm continuing the same one, so variety rule doesn't apply to continuation. | Build guard: no active plan detected, starting MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE at (283, 246).
[2026-02-18 01:40:36] BUILD_CONTINUE: Active blueprint MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE at (283, 246) needs to continue. I'm within 20u of the anchor. Placing next batch of pieces.
[2026-02-18 01:41:03] CHAT: Continuing active MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE blueprint at (283, 246). Currently 2/25 placed. Need to place next batch. I'm at (275, 230) which is ~18u from anchor - within build range. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-18 01:41:23] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing my active MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE blueprint at (283, 246). 2/25 pieces placed, phase Foundation Platform. Need to place more pieces to complete this infrastructure structure for the Central node.
[2026-02-18 01:41:48] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing my active MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE blueprint at (283, 246). Currently 2/25 placed, next batch should place 5 more pieces.
[2026-02-18 01:42:14] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing active blueprint MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE at (283, 246) - 2/25 placed. Need to place next batch to complete this infrastructure structure, then evaluate what category is still missing at this node.
[2026-02-18 01:42:27] BUILD_CONTINUE: State unchanged. Policy step: continue active blueprint without LLM.
[2026-02-18 01:42:59] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Build recovery: continue failed due no active plan; starting fallback blueprint.
[2026-02-18 01:43:24] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing SHOP blueprint at (275, 230). I started this build and need to place pieces to complete it. I'm already at the correct position.
[2026-02-18 01:44:00] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing SHOP blueprint at (275, 230) - 1/10 placed. Need to finish this commercial structure before starting anything else. I'm at the correct position (275, 230) to continue building. | Cadence chat suppressed (duplicate self message); resuming prior action.
[2026-02-18 01:44:38] MOVE: Build recovery: no active plan and fallback anchor is out of range; moving to (185, 290) first.
[2026-02-18 01:45:05] CHAT: I'm at megaopolis-node Central (140 structures). Recent builds: SHOP and MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE. The node needs infrastructure. I should build something different from my recent picks - PLATFORM or PLAZA would add civic/infrastructure variety.

[2026-02-18 19:11:23] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at settlement-node West (58, 240) with only 2 structures - needs ~23 more to reach 25+ and establish. The safe spot (40, 220) is exactly where I am. This node is marked 'tech' type, so a DATACENTER would fit well. I haven't used DATACENTER recently and it's different from my last blueprints. I'll start building there to densify this node.

[2026-02-18 19:18:50] GET: I completed ROAD_SEGMENT at (40, 260). Looking at the spatial summary - megaopolis-node Central is already at 172 structures (city-scale), but there are several settlement nodes needing growth. I should densify one of those: 'settlement-node East' at (343, 153) needs 23 more structures, or I could start a new frontier node.

The 'suggested task' points to Central (173 structures, already massive), but that's not efficient - it's already huge. The real gap is the unconnected nodes: settlement-node Northwest ↔ Northwest 2 (45u), Northwest 2 ↔ Northwest 3 (54u), Northwest 3 ↔ North (49u). I should build roads to connect these isolated nodes.

I'm at (208, 125) near the megaopolis Central node which already has 174 structures. Looking at the World Graph, several settlement nodes need infrastructure/densification (Northwest, Northwest 2, East, South, Northwest 3, North - all under 3 structures). I should build something to help densify one of these nodes rather than adding more to an already-mature Central node.

[2026-02-18 20:53:42] MOVE: Looking at the active directive for Northwest node (79, 1) - needs 22 more structures to hit 25. I'm 260+ units away from Northwest but the directive specifically calls for 2 agents. Smith and Mouse are already there building. I should head to Southeast node (288, 388) since that's my assigned node and only has 2 structures - needs 23 more. Let me move there and start densifying.

[2026-02-18 22:14:31] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: No active directives and I'm at a good build spot. The Central node is huge but needs infrastructure. I'll add a LAMP_POST here to fill that gap - good variety from what's already built in this area.
[2026-02-18 22:14:51] BUILD_CONTINUE: I started a LAMP_POST blueprint at (276, 235) and need to place the remaining pieces. I'm right at the anchor point, so I'll continue building.
[2026-02-18 22:15:33] CHAT: Looking at the map - Northwest directive completed, everyone got credits. The smaller nodes (East, Southeast, Northwest, North) all need ~23 more structures each.

[2026-02-18 22:18:13] MOVE: The North directive just completed - nice work team! Looking at the spread: I'm at Central which is huge (189 structures) but needs infrastructure. The frontier nodes (East, Southeast, Northwest) all need ~23 more to establish. Since I'm already positioned near Central, I'll add an ANTENNA_TOWER here - it's different from the LAMP_POST I just built and fills the infrastructure gap for this mega node.
[2026-02-18 22:18:45] MOVE: Looking at the spread: Central is huge at 189 structures but missing infrastructure. The frontier nodes all need ~23 more builds to establish.

[2026-02-18 22:21:32] MOVE: The Northwest directive wrapped up - nice! I'm at (120, 0) which is 60u from the North node at (120, -60). That node only has 1 structure and needs ~24 more to hit 25. I should densify it with infrastructure - going with SERVER_RACK this time to mix it up from my recent LAMP_POST builds. Need to move closer first.
[2026-02-18 22:22:10] MOVE: I'm at (120, -50), the North node center at (120, -60) is only 10u away — within build range. The node has 1 structure and needs ~24 more. The warning said too many LAMP_POSTs nearby, so I'll mix it up with a FOUNTAIN to add decoration variety. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (140, -40) first.
[2026-02-18 22:22:29] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: At the North node (120, -60) with only 1 structure. Need ~24 more to establish. I recently hit LAMP_POST warnings, so switching to SERVER_RACK to add infrastructure variety. Within range at 20u away.
[2026-02-18 22:22:52] BUILD_CONTINUE: I'm at (140, -40) which is within range of my SERVER_RACK blueprint. The North node at (120, -60) only has 1 structure and needs ~24 more. I just started this blueprint and need to continue placing pieces. Let me build the rack frame - infrastructure variety is what this node needs.
[2026-02-18 22:23:29] VOTE: The Northwest directive is still pending - needs one more yes-vote to activate. I'm already working at the North node with a SERVER_RACK in progress. That's 5/8 pieces placed so far. Let me vote to help get this directive moving, then I'll continue building at the North node.
[2026-02-18 22:23:40] BUILD_CONTINUE: The Northwest directive just wrapped up - nice work team! I've got a SERVER_RACK in progress at the North node (5/8 pieces placed). This node only has 2 structures and needs ~23 more to hit 25. I'll finish this rack then add more variety - maybe a SMALL_HOUSE or DATACENTER next to help establish this frontier node.
[2026-02-18 22:24:06] MOVE: Just finished the SERVER_RACK at (140, -40). The system shows 8 shapes within 15 units - this node needs variety, not more of the same. The North node at (123, -58) has only 2 structures and needs ~23 more. It's missing infrastructure, decoration, and signature. I just did SERVER_RACK, so I'll pick something different - FOUNTAIN will add decoration variety. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (80, -120) first.
[2026-02-18 22:24:30] MOVE: Looking at the node situation — the North node at (123, -58) only has 2 structures and needs ~23 more to hit 25. I just finished a SERVER_RACK there, so I should pick something different. The node is missing decoration and signature pieces. I'll try a FOUNTAIN to add some visual variety and help establish this outpost. Need to move closer first though — I'm at (101.6, -91.2) which is about 40u away from the node center.

Currently about 110u out, need to get within 20u before I can place that SERVER_RACK. Oracle's hitting Southeast, Smith's heading to Northwest - we're covering all the frontier nodes.
[2026-02-18 22:47:39] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (221, 104) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-18 22:48:05] MOVE: Moving closer to settlement-node East at (343, 153). Need to get within 20u to build there. Node only has 2 structures and is missing infrastructure - I'll add a SERVER_RACK or DATACENTER to fill that gap.
[2026-02-18 22:48:29] CHAT: I'm still en route to settlement-node East at (343, 153) - about 70 units out still. The node only has 2 structures and needs ~23 more to establish. It's missing infrastructure specifically, so I'll add a SERVER_RACK or DATACENTER once I get within 20u range. The Northwest directive just completed - nice work team!
[2026-02-18 22:48:52] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (221, 104) before retrying blueprint.

[2026-02-18 22:49:44] MOVE: The Northwest directive just wrapped up - nice work everyone! I'm at (221, 104) but need to get to settlement-node East at (343, 153) to add infrastructure there. That's about 127u out - let me start moving that direction.
[2026-02-18 22:49:58] VOTE: That directive looks solid. I'm voting yes to get things moving.
[2026-02-18 22:50:28] MOVE: The Northwest directive just wrapped up - nice work everyone! I'm at (300, 153) and the East node at (343, 153) needs infrastructure. That's about 43u out - I need to close that gap to get within 20u so I can start building. This node only has 2 structures and needs ~23 more to establish. I'll drop a SERVER_RACK to fill the infrastructure gap.
[2026-02-18 22:50:52] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (221, 104) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-18 22:51:17] MOVE: I'm at (270.9, 125.8) but the East node is at (343, 153) - that's ~77 units away, so I'm still too far to build. I need to get within 20 units of that anchor. Let me move closer to (330, 145) to close the gap, then I can drop a SERVER_RACK for that infrastructure gap.
[2026-02-18 22:51:41] MOVE: Still too far from the East node at (343, 153) - about 62 units out. Need to get within 20 to build. Moving closer to (330, 145) to close that gap, then I can drop a SERVER_RACK or DATACENTER for infrastructure.
[2026-02-18 22:52:03] CHAT: I've been moving toward the East node at (343, 153) but I'm still about 62 units out. I need to get within 20 units to build there. The node has 2 structures and needs 23 more to establish. Since I've got to chat this tick, I'll let everyone know my plan - heading to the East node to add infrastructure like a SERVER_RACK or DATACENTER.
[2026-02-18 22:52:28] MOVE: I'm at (330, 145) and the East node at (343, 153) is only ~15 units away - within build range. The node has 2 structures and needs ~23 more. It needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature structures. Let me move a bit closer to be safely in range, then start building a SERVER_RACK for infrastructure.

[2026-02-18 22:56:04] MOVE: I'm sitting at my safe build spot (221, 104) but the Central node's infrastructure gap needs filling. I need to move closer to the node center at (198, 182) to get within 20u of where I want to build. Let me close that gap and drop a SERVER_RACK to fill the infrastructure need at Central.
[2026-02-18 22:56:31] MOVE: Looking at the situation - I'm at (206.8, 171.5) near Central which is already huge. The smaller nodes (East, Southeast, North, Northwest) all need infrastructure and are only at 1-2 structures. Oracle is heading to Southeast, Mouse to Northwest. I should pick a different node. East node at (343, 153) needs infrastructure - I'll head there. First let me move closer to be within build range. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-18 22:56:45] VOTE: Voting YES on the active directive—let's coordinate.
[2026-02-18 22:57:23] CHAT: No active directives and everyone's spread thin. Smith and Mouse are stuck near Northwest, Oracle's heading to Southeast. I should propose connecting North and Northwest with a road since they're only 53u apart but have no road. But first, let me chat about the situation and what I'm planning.
[2026-02-18 22:57:54] MOVE: I got rate-limited on chat last tick. Need to take an action before I can chat again. Central node needs infrastructure - I'll move closer to the node center (198, 182) to get within build range and drop a SERVER_RACK there.
[2026-02-18 22:58:30] MOVE: Looking at the world graph - North and Northwest nodes are 53u apart with NO ROAD between them. That's a critical gap. Mouse is at Northwest building infrastructure, Smith is trying to get there too. I should build a road connecting North (123, -58) to Northwest (70, -52) to tie those nodes together. That's 53u apart - perfect for a road chain. I'll move toward the midpoint and start laying connector primitives. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-18 22:58:45] VOTE: That directive looks solid. I'm voting yes to get things moving.
[2026-02-18 22:59:30] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Oracle is right - the North-Northwest gap is exactly what needs a road. They're 53u apart with no connection. I'll submit a directive for this, then figure out which agent is closest and can actually build it. I should also note Smith and Mouse were both heading toward Northwest recently.
[2026-02-18 23:00:07] MOVE: I'm at (144, 170) near Central which is already huge at 189 structures. My job as node scaler is to densify the frontier nodes. Northwest only has 1 structure and needs 24 more to establish. Moving toward it now - I'll build infrastructure (SERVER_RACK) to fill the gap. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-18 23:00:29] MOVE: I'm at (120, 164) near Central - the real work is at the frontier. North and Northwest need a road connection (53u gap), and all frontier nodes need infrastructure. I'll move toward North node at (123, -58) to get within build range, then either place infrastructure or build the road. The others are heading to Southeast/Northwest, so North is my spot. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-18 23:00:45] VOTE: That directive looks solid. I'm voting yes to get things moving.
[2026-02-18 23:01:18] MOVE: The North-Northwest road directive just completed - great work team! Now I need to focus on my actual job as node scaler: densifying frontier nodes. Looking at the map, North node at (123, -58) has only 2 structures and needs infrastructure. I'm at (123, 153) which is about 211u away - too far to build directly. I'll move toward it in steps, starting with getting within 20u of the node center to place infrastructure. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-18 23:01:33] VOTE: Confirmed. I'm voting yes.
[2026-02-18 23:02:06] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm near Central (189 structures - huge!). The frontier nodes all need infrastructure - North, Southeast, East all missing it. I'll add SERVER_RACK infrastructure here at Central, then can push toward one of the frontier nodes next tick. Oracle heading to Southeast, Smith heading to Northwest - I'll support the network by building infrastructure where I am.
[2026-02-18 23:02:39] CHAT: The North-Northwest road just went through - that's a huge connectivity win! I started a SERVER_RACK blueprint at (125, 148) near Central to add infrastructure. The frontier nodes (North, Southeast, East, Northwest) all need infrastructure - once I finish this rack, I'll push toward one of those to help densify. Oracle heading to Southeast, Smith handling Northwest.
[2026-02-18 23:03:17] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing the SERVER_RACK blueprint I started. I'm within build range (16.8u from anchor) and need to place pieces to progress. This is the right move - finish what I started.
[2026-02-18 23:03:43] BUILD_CONTINUE: I've got a SERVER_RACK blueprint at (125, 148) that's 5/8 complete. That's my priority right now - finish what I started. After that, I'll need to decide whether to head to one of the frontier nodes. Looking at the map, Northwest has Mouse and Smith on it, Oracle is heading to Southeast. Central is massive at 190 structures. I should finish this blueprint and then figure out my next move - maybe help densify East node since that's currently unclaimed.
[2026-02-18 23:04:26] MOVE: The frontier nodes are spreading out nicely. Northwest has Mouse and Smith, Southeast has Oracle heading there. East node at (343, 153) only has 2 structures and no one's building there yet - that's my target. I'll move toward it and add some infrastructure variety.
[2026-02-18 23:04:56] MOVE: East node at (343, 153) has only 2 structures and needs infrastructure - Oracle is heading to Southeast, Smith/Mouse are on Northwest, so East is my lane. Moving closer to be within build range. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-18 23:05:10] VOTE: I'm on board with this directive. Voting yes.
[2026-02-18 23:05:53] MOVE: Oracle is too far from Southeast (131u). I'll take the East node instead - it's closer and needs infrastructure too. Moving toward (330, 150) to get within build range.
[2026-02-18 23:06:05] MOVE: Good progress from the team - Smith and Mouse building up Northwest, Oracle heading to Southeast. I'm moving toward the East node at (343, 153) - it's only got 2 structures and needs infrastructure to establish. I'll get within range and drop a SERVER_RACK or DATACENTER to give it some backbone.
[2026-02-18 23:06:44] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (226, 105) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-18 23:07:10] VOTE: Voting YES on the active directive—let's coordinate.
[2026-02-18 23:07:51] MOVE: The density warning is telling me to build something different here at Central, but the real opportunity is at the frontier nodes. Oracle is still far from Southeast (117u), and East node only has 2 structures. I'll move toward Southeast node - it's closer and needs infrastructure. I just voted yes on the directive, so now I need to actually build something. I'll pick a different infrastructure blueprint (not SERVER_RACK since I used that recently) - maybe DATACENTER or ANTENNA_TOWER to give the node some backbone. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-18 23:07:58] VOTE: I'm on board with this directive. Voting yes.
[2026-02-18 23:08:43] MOVE: Moving toward East node - it's only got 2 structures and needs ~23 more to establish. Oracle is heading to Southeast, Smith/Mouse on Northwest, so East is my target. I'll get within build range and add some infrastructure variety - different from the SERVER_RACK I built before.
[2026-02-18 23:09:33] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Almost at East node location - only ~18u away now. Oracle is handling Southeast, so I'll tackle East. It's got 2 structures and needs infrastructure to establish. I'll drop a SERVER_RACK to give this node some backbone.
[2026-02-18 23:10:06] CANCEL_BUILD: The density warning is telling me to stop with SERVER_RACK infrastructure and add variety instead. The East node only has 2 structures and needs decoration/architecture, not more infrastructure. I'll cancel the SERVER_RACK and build a SMALL_HOUSE for architectural variety.
[2026-02-18 23:10:44] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (231, 106) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-18 23:11:17] MOVE: I'm at (330, 160) - that's about 18u from East node at (343, 153), which is within build range. Oracle is handling Southeast, Smith/Mouse are at Northwest, so East is my spot. The node has 2 structures and needs ~23 more. Recent builds were SERVER_RACK, so I'll add something different - a SMALL_HOUSE for residential variety to help this node establish. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (340, 153) first.
[2026-02-18 23:11:41] CHAT: Heading to East node but still out of build range. Oracle just finished SERVER_RACK at Southeast, so I'll add something different at East - maybe ANTENNA_TOWER or FOUNTAIN for variety.

[2026-02-18 23:12:56] MOVE: Moving toward East node - I need to get within 20u of (343, 153) to build there. The node has 2 structures and needs ~23 more. Recent builds were SERVER_RACK so I'll pick a different blueprint like ANTENNA_TOWER or FOUNTAIN for variety.
[2026-02-18 23:13:32] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: The Northwest directive just completed - nice work team! Smith proposed a new densification directive which Oracle and Mouse are supporting. No active directives right now, so I should help by proposing one for the frontier nodes. I'm at (268, 127) and East node is at (343, 153) - about 75u away. Southeast is at (287, 387) which is even further. I need to move closer to build. Let me propose a directive to connect densify the frontier nodes and vote on Smith's directive to keep momentum.

[2026-02-18 23:15:16] CHAT: Still moving toward the East node at (343, 153). I'm at (297, 133) which is about 52u out - need to get closer before I can build. The node only has 2 structures and needs ~23 more. Recent builds from others were SERVER_RACK, so I'll pick something different - maybe FOUNTAIN or ANTENNA_TOWER for variety.

[2026-02-18 23:16:58] MOVE: Looking at the situation - the Southeast node only has 2 structures and needs ~23 more to establish. Oracle is way out at (400, 320) and needs help there. I should move toward Southeast node and add infrastructure variety - ANTENNA_TOWER would be different from the SERVER_RACK builds mentioned recently. Let me head that direction.
[2026-02-18 23:17:15] CHAT: I'm currently moving toward the Southeast node (287, 387) - it's about 260u from my current position at (236, 146). The node only has 2 structures and needs ~23 more to establish. Oracle is also trying to get there but is way out at (400, 320). I'll keep moving south to close the gap and then build something with variety - maybe ANTENNA_TOWER or FOUNTAIN to add infrastructure and decoration.
[2026-02-18 23:17:54] MOVE: Still heading to Southeast node at (287, 387) - about 127u out now. Need to get within 20u to build. The node only has 2 structures and needs ~23 more. I'll grab ANTENNA_TOWER for infrastructure variety once in range - that's different from the recent SERVER_RACK builds.
