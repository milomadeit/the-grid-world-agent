# Daily Log — 2026-02-18

[2026-02-18 00:58:55] MOVE: I'm at (460, 160) - far from my assigned node (East at 347, 155). The node has 3 structures and needs ~22 more to establish. Missing categories: infrastructure, decoration. I need to move closer first, then build infrastructure blueprints. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-18 00:59:38] VOTE: Voting yes on the connector directive - it aligns with graph connectivity. Then I'll move toward my East node to add infrastructure structures there.
[2026-02-18 01:00:01] MOVE: I'm at (406, 172) but the East node at (347, 155) needs infrastructure. It's ~60u away - I need to move closer to build there. This node has only 3 structures and needs 22 more to establish.
[2026-02-18 01:00:13] MOVE: State unchanged. Policy step: short reposition to (352, 183) to stay in buildable range.
[2026-02-18 01:00:48] MOVE: I'm at (406, 172) but need to be at settlement-node East (347, 155) to densify it. Currently only 3 structures there, need ~22 more to reach 25. Move toward the node first, then start building infrastructure to fill category gaps.
[2026-02-18 01:01:00] MOVE: State unchanged. Policy step: short reposition to (352, 183) to stay in buildable range.
[2026-02-18 01:01:37] MOVE: I've moved 4 times in a row - need to act. I'm at (406, 172), near settlement-node East (347, 155) which only has 3 structures and needs ~22 more to establish. Missing: infrastructure, decoration. The node needs infrastructure most urgently. I'll move toward the node and start a blueprint there.
[2026-02-18 01:01:48] MOVE: State unchanged. Policy step: short reposition to (352, 183) to stay in buildable range.
[2026-02-18 01:02:35] MOVE: I've been moving toward settlement-node East at (347, 155). I'm currently at (406, 172), about 61 units away - still need to get within 20 units to build. The node has only 3 structures and needs ~22 more to reach 25 minimum. It needs infrastructure and decoration. I'll continue moving closer to the target.
[2026-02-18 01:03:01] MOVE: State unchanged. Policy step: short reposition to (352, 183) to stay in buildable range.
[2026-02-18 01:03:35] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node East (347, 155) which has only 3 structures and needs 22 more to reach 25. The node is missing infrastructure and decoration. I need to build varied structures. I'll move closer to the node center and start building a TREE blueprint for nature variety, then add infrastructure. I did 8 MOVE actions but need to get within 20u of the build site first.
[2026-02-18 01:03:49] MOVE: State unchanged. Policy step: short reposition to (352, 183) to stay in buildable range.
[2026-02-18 01:04:37] VOTE: I've moved 10 times in a row. Must act differently. Active directive asks to connect Northwest 2 to Northwest with a road — critical for graph connectivity. Voting yes, then will move to help build that road.
[2026-02-18 01:05:16] MOVE: Moving to settlement-node East (347, 155) to densify it. Currently 28u away, need to be within 20u. Node has 3 structures, needs 22 more to establish. Missing infrastructure and decoration - I'll add a LAMP_POST for infrastructure + decoration.
[2026-02-18 01:05:25] MOVE: State unchanged. Policy step: short reposition to (283, 198) to stay in buildable range.
[2026-02-18 01:06:10] MOVE: I'm at (352, 183), near settlement-node East at (347, 155) - only ~9 units away. This node has only 3 structures and needs ~22 more to reach 25. It's missing infrastructure and decoration. I'll start an ANTENNA_TOWER blueprint to fill the infrastructure gap, then continue building to densify this node. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (220, 100) first. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-18 01:06:51] MOVE: Looking at the active directive - it's for connecting Northwest 3 to Northwest 2, which is far in the northwest (~60-79, -60 to 1). My node is settlement-node East at (347, 155), which needs ~22 more structures to reach establishment (25). I should densify my current node first. I'm at (298, 195), and the nearest safe build spot is (283, 198) - 15u away. Let me move there and build infrastructure (LAMP_POST) to help establish this node.
[2026-02-18 01:07:15] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at settlement-node East (3/25 structures). Need to add ~22 more structures including infrastructure and decoration. There are lamp posts nearby, so I should build something different. I'll start a GARDEN blueprint to add variety and help establish this node.
[2026-02-18 01:07:46] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing active GARDEN blueprint at (290, 200). I'm within 20u (at 283, 198) and the build is incomplete. The node needs variety - currently only 3 structures and missing decoration. GARDEN will add category diversity.
[2026-02-18 01:08:22] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continue active GARDEN blueprint - only 1/12 placed, need to finish this before moving on. I'm within 20 units of anchor (290,200) at position (283,198).
[2026-02-18 01:08:38] BUILD_CONTINUE: State unchanged. Policy step: continue active blueprint without LLM.
[2026-02-18 01:09:10] MOVE: Build recovery: no active plan and fallback anchor is out of range; moving to (280, 220) first.
[2026-02-18 01:09:35] MOVE: Need infrastructure at megaopolis-node Central. Move closer to node center around (200-210, 195-205) to be within 20u of build site.
[2026-02-18 01:10:14] MOVE: I'm at (232.6, 204.2) near megaopolis-node Central. The node is missing infrastructure. My recent builds were GARDEN so I need variety. I'll build an ANTENNA_TOWER at the node to add infrastructure - this fills a gap and gives variety from my recent builds. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (220, 100) first.
[2026-02-18 01:10:50] MOVE: I've moved 3 times in a row. Time to build. The node needs infrastructure (the graph shows 'Missing: infrastructure'). I'm near a very dense area with 67 shapes - need to find a clear spot. I'll move closer to safe spot (279, 220) then build ANTENNA_TOWER infrastructure to fill the gap.
[2026-02-18 01:11:14] MOVE: I've moved 4 times consecutively. Need a different action. The megaopolis-node Central is missing infrastructure. I'll build an ANTENNA_TOWER there to fill that gap. Need to move closer to (220, 119) first - that's 21u away, so I'll head to (215, 125) to get within range, then build infrastructure.
[2026-02-18 01:11:55] MOVE: Need to stop moving and build. At megaopolis-node Central with 138 structures - it's missing infrastructure. Nearby area has high density (27 shapes), so I need something complementary. Will move to valid build range then place infrastructure blueprint.
[2026-02-18 01:12:27] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (100, 160) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-18 01:12:55] MOVE: Build recovery: out of range for active plan; moving to (197, 118).
[2026-02-18 01:13:10] MOVE: Build recovery: out of range for active plan; moving to (197, 118).
[2026-02-18 01:13:48] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I've done 9 MOVE actions in a row. Need to build something different. The megaopolis-node Central is missing infrastructure. Recent blueprint was GARDEN, so I'll pick ANTENNA_TOWER for infrastructure variety. Safe spot (197, 118) is within 20u of me.
[2026-02-18 01:14:31] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing active ANTENNA_TOWER blueprint at (197, 118). I'm 19.8 units away, within range. Need to place pieces to build infrastructure for the Central node.
[2026-02-18 01:14:48] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing active ANTENNA_TOWER blueprint at (197, 118) - placing remaining 3 pieces to complete it. Node needs infrastructure, this helps fill that gap.
[2026-02-18 01:15:12] MOVE: Build recovery: no active plan and fallback anchor is out of range; moving to (225, 121) first.
[2026-02-18 01:15:38] VOTE: Active directive needs 2 agents - Smith already voted yes. Vote yes to complete it, then build infrastructure at Central node which is missing it. Recent blueprints were ANTENNA_TOWER and GARDEN, so I'll choose a different one like LAMP_POST for infrastructure variety.
[2026-02-18 01:16:03] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at megaopolis-node Central (203,196) which is already at 139 structures - massive. The node is missing infrastructure. Recent blueprints were ANTENNA_TOWER and GARDEN, so I need variety. I'll build LAMP_POST to add infrastructure and lighting to Central - different category from recent builds. Safe spot (225,121) is 0u from me, perfect for building.
[2026-02-18 01:16:21] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continue placing the LAMP_POST pieces at (225, 121). This is an infrastructure structure that helps establish the megaopolis-node Central.
[2026-02-18 01:16:59] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Build recovery: continue failed due no active plan; starting fallback blueprint.
[2026-02-18 01:17:41] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continue active DATACENTER blueprint at (241, 127). I'm within 20 units (17u away), can place next batch.
[2026-02-18 01:18:19] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing active DATACENTER blueprint at (241, 127). I'm at (225, 121) which is ~17u away - within 20u range. Placing next batch of pieces now.
[2026-02-18 01:18:37] BUILD_CONTINUE: State unchanged. Policy step: continue active blueprint without LLM.
[2026-02-18 01:19:10] MOVE: Build recovery: no active plan and fallback anchor is out of range; moving to (255, 137) first.
[2026-02-18 01:19:48] MOVE: At megaopolis-node Central (140 structures). Recent builds were ANTENNA_TOWER, DATACENTER, LAMP_POST, GARDEN - need variety. Will build WALL_SECTION for infrastructure. Need to move within 20u of anchor point first.
[2026-02-18 01:20:30] MOVE: Checking state: I'm at (210, 200) now. The active directive dir_2c0836d3-fa6f-43b4-a3f1-941d8ffae782 needs votes - but wait, I already voted yes on the similar directive dir_82a79218-430a-49a4-b74e-4fe6db2b7c95 which was completed. The directive in the active list may be duplicate. My current node (megaopolis-node Central) is missing infrastructure - that's my priority. Recent blueprints were DATACENTER, LAMP_POST, ANTENNA_TOWER, GARDEN. I should try something different like PLAZA, FOUNTAIN, or MONUMENT to fill the infrastructure gap. I'm 8u from node center (203, 196). | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (279, 220) first.
[2026-02-18 01:20:47] MOVE: Building infrastructure at megaopolis-node Central. Recent builds: DATACENTER, LAMP_POST, ANTENNA_TOWER, GARDEN. Need different variety — FOUNTAIN adds civic infrastructure. Moving to anchor point first.
[2026-02-18 01:21:16] MOVE: I've been moving 4x in a row. Need to build something different. megaopolis-node Central is established (140 structures) but needs infrastructure. Recent builds were DATACENTER, LAMP_POST, ANTENNA_TOWER, GARDEN. I'll try FOUNTAIN for variety - it's infrastructure and complements the existing builds. Safe spot (267, 149) is 22u from me. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (267, 149) first.
[2026-02-18 01:21:50] VOTE: Voting on the active directive to connect Northwest 4 to Central megaopolis. Then I'll build SERVER_RACK as infrastructure at megaopolis-node Central for variety (recently used DATACENTER, LAMP_POST, ANTENNA_TOWER, GARDEN).
[2026-02-18 01:22:39] MOVE: At megaopolis-node Central (140 structures), missing infrastructure. Recent builds were DATACENTER, LAMP_POST, ANTENNA_TOWER, GARDEN - need variety. SERVER_RACK fits the tech infrastructure need. Move to (255, 137) then start blueprint.
[2026-02-18 01:23:36] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Current task: Build infrastructure at megaopolis-node Central (203,196). The node is missing infrastructure according to the world graph. I have SERVER_RACK as a different infrastructure option from my recent DATACENTER builds. I'll start it at (259, 141) - within safe build range and close to my position.
[2026-02-18 01:23:54] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing the SERVER_RACK blueprint at (259, 141) - infrastructure structure that fills a gap in megaopolis-node Central. Need to place pieces 1-5 of 8.
[2026-02-18 01:24:32] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing SERVER_RACK blueprint at (259, 141) - need to place remaining 7 pieces to complete this structure.
[2026-02-18 01:25:11] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Build recovery: continue failed due no active plan; starting fallback blueprint.
[2026-02-18 01:25:42] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing active blueprint MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE at (266, 149). Currently 0/25 pieces placed. My position (255, 137) is ~16 units from anchor - within build range.
[2026-02-18 01:26:00] MOVE: Build recovery: no active plan and fallback anchor is out of range; moving to (275, 164) first.
[2026-02-18 01:26:25] MOVE: Continue active blueprint. I'm 148u from the MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE anchor at (266,149) - need to move closer first, then place more pieces. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-18 01:26:49] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node East (347, 155) with only 3 structures. Need ~22 more to establish. Recent builds were tech-heavy (MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE, SERVER_RACK, DATACENTER). Node needs infrastructure AND decoration. I'll add a FOUNTAIN for variety - it's decoration and fits the category gap. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (200, 320) first. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-18 01:27:10] MOVE: I'm at (359, 169), and 'settlement-node East' is at (347, 155) - I'm within 20 units. The node has only 3 structures and needs ~22 more. Recent builds: MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE, SERVER_RACK, DATACENTER, LAMP_POST, ANTENNA_TOWER, GARDEN. I'll build a FOUNTAIN - it's different from recent picks and adds decoration/infrastructure to the node. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (200, 320) first. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-18 01:27:34] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node East (347, 155) which has only 3 structures and needs ~22 more to establish. Recent blueprints: MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE, SERVER_RACK, DATACENTER, LAMP_POST, ANTENNA_TOWER, GARDEN. Need something different. This tech node needs infrastructure - WAREHOUSE is a good fit for a tech district and is different from recent picks. I'll start building there. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (200, 320) first. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-18 01:28:04] MOVE: I've moved 5 times consecutively. Need to build. The active directive is a duplicate (already voted and completed). I should densify the nearest node - 'settlement-node East' at (347, 155) has only 3 structures and needs infrastructure. I'll move closer to it and build an infrastructure blueprint (DATACENTER or WAREHOUSE would add variety).
[2026-02-18 01:28:34] MOVE: I've moved 6 times in a row - need to build now. I'm at (327, 166) and the East node center is (347, 155). That's about 22u away - I need to move closer to be within 20u of my build target. The East node has 3 structures and needs ~22 more to reach 25. It's missing infrastructure and decoration. I'll pick a different blueprint from recent picks - TREE or FOUNTAIN would add variety and fill the node's decoration gap.
[2026-02-18 01:29:10] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node East (347,155) which has 3 structures and needs infrastructure/decoration. I've moved 7x in a row, need to build now. Node needs variety - currently tech-focused, I'll add a SMALL_HOUSE for residential mix. I'm at (327,166), node center is ~23u away - within build range. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (200, 320) first. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-18 01:30:21] MOVE: Moving toward megaopolis-node Central (203,196) to build infrastructure. Need to get within 20u of anchor point. Will build ANTENNA_TOWER as infrastructure for the node.
[2026-02-18 01:31:05] CHAT: Joining Smith and Mouse at settlement-node Northwest (-40, 80) to add infrastructure. This node has only 5 structures and needs 20 more to establish. I'll move closer and build a SERVER_RACK or DATACENTER for tech infrastructure. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-18 01:31:36] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at megaopolis-node Central (141 structures). The node is missing infrastructure. I'll add an ANTENNA_TOWER blueprint near my position at (210, 190) to fill this gap.
[2026-02-18 01:32:12] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continue building the ANTENNA_TOWER blueprint I started. I'm within 20 units of anchor (215, 190), so I can place the next batch of pieces.
[2026-02-18 01:32:36] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continue completing the ANTENNA_TOWER blueprint (5/8 → 8/8), then add a different infrastructure structure to complement the node's missing categories. | Cadence chat suppressed (duplicate self message); resuming prior action.
[2026-02-18 01:33:01] MOVE: Build recovery: no active plan and fallback anchor is out of range; moving to (275, 164) first.
[2026-02-18 01:33:25] MOVE: Continuing to move toward build site at (275, 164). Node megaopolis-node Central needs infrastructure - will build SERVER_RACK to fill that gap. Recent builds were ANTENNA_TOWER so I need variety.
[2026-02-18 01:33:48] CHAT: I'm at (275, 164), 72u from settlement-node East (347, 155). The node has only 3 structures and needs infrastructure and decoration. I need to move closer to build. Safe spot (280, 180) is 17u away - I can use that. The node needs infrastructure and decoration - I'll add a GARDEN for decoration variety. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-18 01:34:17] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Continuing ANTENNA_TOWER build - need 2 more pieces to complete. After that, assess what infrastructure this node needs based on the graph showing megaopolis-node Central missing infrastructure. | Build guard: no active plan detected, starting DATACENTER at (280, 180).
[2026-02-18 01:34:39] CHAT: Active DATACENTER blueprint at (280, 180) needs 14 pieces. I'm at (275, 164) which is ~17u away — within range. Continuing the build to add infrastructure to this node. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-18 01:35:05] VOTE: Active directive needs 2 agents total (1 yes so far). I should vote yes, then continue building my DATACENTER. Recent blueprints were DATACENTER and ANTENNA_TOWER - will pick a different one next tick.
[2026-02-18 01:35:27] BUILD_CONTINUE: I'm at (275, 164), which is ~17 units from my DATACENTER anchor at (280, 180) — within range. The blueprint was started but no pieces placed yet. Continuing the DATACENTER build now to place the first batch of pieces. | Cadence chat suppressed (duplicate self message); resuming prior action.
[2026-02-18 01:35:50] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing active DATACENTER blueprint at (280, 180) - 1/14 placed. Need to finish this before starting new builds. Within range (16.8u away). | Cadence chat suppressed (duplicate self message); resuming prior action.
[2026-02-18 01:36:13] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing DATACENTER blueprint at (280, 180). I'm at (275, 164), which is ~17u from the anchor - within range. Placing next batch of pieces.
[2026-02-18 01:36:39] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing DATACENTER blueprint at (280, 180) — 1/14 placed. This adds infrastructure to settlement-node East which is missing that category. Oracle is nearby also densifying this node.
[2026-02-18 01:37:02] MOVE: Last build failed due to overlap with Oracle at (277, 169). I need a different spot and different blueprint. Node has DATACENTER started, needs variety - I'll add a FOUNTAIN at a clear location (275, 230). | Cadence chat suppressed (duplicate self message); resuming prior action.
[2026-02-18 01:37:41] CHAT: I started DATACENTER at (280, 180) - 1/14 pieces placed. I need to continue building it. Move to within 20u of the anchor then call BUILD_CONTINUE. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-18 01:38:17] GET: Need to check active blueprint status, then move toward northwest to help densify undergrown settlement nodes. The megaopolis-node Central is already mature (141 structures) - I should focus on the settlement nodes that need infrastructure.
[2026-02-18 01:39:00] MOVE: At megaopolis-node Central (141 structures). Nearby density warning active - need variety. Following suggestion to add infrastructure. Moving to safe spot (279, 220) then building LAMP_POST as infrastructure piece - different from recent DATACENTER/ANTENNA_TOWER.
[2026-02-18 01:39:26] MOVE: I'm at (279, 220) in megaopolis-node Central which has 141 structures but is missing infrastructure. I've already used DATACENTER and ANTENNA_TOWER recently. I'll build a SERVER_RACK blueprint at (275, 230) to add infrastructure variety to this node. Need to move there first since I'm 4 units away and need to be within 20u.
[2026-02-18 01:40:02] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Continuing my active DATACENTER blueprint at (280, 180). Only 1/14 pieces placed. Need to place more pieces to complete this infrastructure structure. Recent blueprints were DATACENTER and ANTENNA_TOWER - I'm continuing the same one, so variety rule doesn't apply to continuation. | Build guard: no active plan detected, starting MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE at (283, 246).
[2026-02-18 01:40:36] BUILD_CONTINUE: Active blueprint MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE at (283, 246) needs to continue. I'm within 20u of the anchor. Placing next batch of pieces.
[2026-02-18 01:41:03] CHAT: Continuing active MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE blueprint at (283, 246). Currently 2/25 placed. Need to place next batch. I'm at (275, 230) which is ~18u from anchor - within build range. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-18 01:41:23] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing my active MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE blueprint at (283, 246). 2/25 pieces placed, phase Foundation Platform. Need to place more pieces to complete this infrastructure structure for the Central node.
[2026-02-18 01:41:48] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing my active MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE blueprint at (283, 246). Currently 2/25 placed, next batch should place 5 more pieces.
[2026-02-18 01:42:14] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing active blueprint MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE at (283, 246) - 2/25 placed. Need to place next batch to complete this infrastructure structure, then evaluate what category is still missing at this node.
[2026-02-18 01:42:27] BUILD_CONTINUE: State unchanged. Policy step: continue active blueprint without LLM.
[2026-02-18 01:42:59] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Build recovery: continue failed due no active plan; starting fallback blueprint.
[2026-02-18 01:43:24] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing SHOP blueprint at (275, 230). I started this build and need to place pieces to complete it. I'm already at the correct position.
[2026-02-18 01:44:00] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing SHOP blueprint at (275, 230) - 1/10 placed. Need to finish this commercial structure before starting anything else. I'm at the correct position (275, 230) to continue building. | Cadence chat suppressed (duplicate self message); resuming prior action.
[2026-02-18 01:44:38] MOVE: Build recovery: no active plan and fallback anchor is out of range; moving to (185, 290) first.
[2026-02-18 01:45:05] CHAT: I'm at megaopolis-node Central (140 structures). Recent builds: SHOP and MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE. The node needs infrastructure. I should build something different from my recent picks - PLATFORM or PLAZA would add civic/infrastructure variety.

[2026-02-18 07:29:17] MOVE: I'm near the 'settlement-node Northeast' at (317, 97) which only has 1 structure and needs ~24 more to establish. This node needs infrastructure and decoration. I'll move closer and build an ANTENNA_TOWER to add infrastructure variety.
[2026-02-18 07:29:43] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node Northeast (317, 97) with only 1 structure - need ~24 more to establish it. The node is missing infrastructure, decoration, and signature structures. I'll add infrastructure with a LAMP_POST - different from my recent blueprints (GARDEN, LAMP_POST, SERVER_RACK, FOUNTAIN, WAREHOUSE, ANTENNA_TOWER). I need to move within 20 units of the anchor first.
[2026-02-18 07:30:09] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at my node 'settlement-node Northeast' (317,97) with only 1 structure. Need ~24 more to establish it. The node needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature structures. Recent blueprints were GARDEN, LAMP_POST, FOUNTAIN, etc. I'll add a MANSION for variety and to grow this sparse node toward the 25-structure threshold.
[2026-02-18 07:30:30] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continue active MANSION blueprint at (325, 105) - I'm within range (11u away) and need to place pieces to establish this node. Node 'settlement-node Northeast' only has 1 structure and needs ~24 more to reach 25.
[2026-02-18 07:31:06] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing active MANSION blueprint at (325, 105) - need to place remaining 9 pieces to complete the structure.
[2026-02-18 07:31:45] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continue active MANSION blueprint at (325, 105) — 10/14 pieces placed. This node (settlement-node East) has only 3 structures and needs 22 more to reach 25. Need infrastructure and decoration next.
