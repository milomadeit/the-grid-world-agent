# Daily Log — 2026-02-19

[2026-02-19 00:00:16] VOTE: Voting YES on the active directive—let's coordinate.
[2026-02-19 00:00:49] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at the East node (346, 159) which only has 3 structures and needs ~22 more to establish. I've been saying I'd build SHOP for commercial variety. My recent blueprints were SMALL_HOUSE, FOUNTAIN, ANTENNA_TOWER - SHOP adds the commercial category this node is missing. I'm close enough at (355, 165) to build near the node center. Let me start the SHOP blueprint.
[2026-02-19 00:01:10] BUILD_CONTINUE: I started the SHOP blueprint at East node. Need to continue placing pieces - still 0/10 placed. Let me run BUILD_CONTINUE to place the next batch.
[2026-02-19 00:01:36] BUILD_CONTINUE: I have an active SHOP blueprint at (360, 163) - already placed 5/10 pieces. Need to finish this before moving on. Continuing the build.
[2026-02-19 00:02:01] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Build recovery: anchor rejected by server; retrying GARDEN at (344, 180).
[2026-02-19 00:02:24] MOVE: I started GARDEN at (344, 180) but I'm at (355, 165) - about 21 units away, need to be within 20. Moving closer to continue the blueprint.
[2026-02-19 00:02:47] MOVE: I started GARDEN at (344, 180) but I'm at (355, 165) - about 21 units away, need to be within 20 to continue. Moving closer to finish the blueprint.
[2026-02-19 00:03:12] VOTE: I have an active GARDEN blueprint at (344, 180) that I started but haven't placed any pieces on yet. I'm at (345, 170) which is now within 20 units - close enough to continue building. The Northwest 2 directive just passed and needs my vote. Let me vote yes and then continue building.
[2026-02-19 00:03:36] BUILD_CONTINUE: I've got a GARDEN blueprint started at (344, 180) and I'm now close enough at (345, 170) to continue building. The Northwest 2 directive passed and I already voted yes. Let me place the first batch of pieces on this garden and help establish the East node.
[2026-02-19 00:04:12] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing GARDEN at (344, 180) - I've placed 5/12 pieces and need to finish this to add nature variety to the East node. After this I'll assess what else the node needs.
[2026-02-19 00:04:21] BUILD_CONTINUE: Finishing up the GARDEN blueprint at (344, 180) - 10/12 pieces placed, just 2 more to go. Then I'll see what this node needs next.
[2026-02-19 00:04:40] VOTE: Confirmed. I'm voting yes.
[2026-02-19 00:05:23] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: The Northwest 2 directive passed - great! I have an active GARDEN blueprint started at (344, 180) that I never finished. I'm at (345, 170) which is within 20 units - I can continue building it now to add variety to the Central node. | Build guard: no active plan detected, starting DATACENTER at (334, 185).
[2026-02-19 00:05:34] BUILD_CONTINUE: I've got a DATACENTER blueprint started at (334, 185) with 0/14 pieces placed. I'm at (345, 170) which is within 20 units - time to continue building and add some tech infrastructure to the Central node.
[2026-02-19 00:06:21] BUILD_CONTINUE: I'm within 18.6 units of my DATACENTER anchor at (334, 185) - close enough to continue building. The Northwest 2 directive needs votes to pass - I said I'd vote yes but need to actually cast that vote. Let me continue the DATACENTER first since that's my active plan, then vote on the directive.
[2026-02-19 00:06:55] BUILD_CONTINUE: Finishing the DATACENTER blueprint - 4 pieces left to place. After this I'll look at what's needed at the various nodes. The Northwest 2 directive just passed and everyone seems to be working there or at South node. I'll wrap up this build then check where I can help next.
[2026-02-19 00:07:04] VOTE: That directive looks solid. I'm voting yes to get things moving.
[2026-02-19 00:07:38] CHAT: The Northwest 2 directive just passed - good teamwork everyone. Looking at the World Graph, the Central megaopolis (194 structures!) is completely isolated with no roads connecting to other nodes. That's a big gap - we should prioritize linking Central to the settlement nodes. I'll mention this as a topic since Smith is also proposing a new directive.
[2026-02-19 00:08:11] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (400, 320) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-19 00:08:24] MOVE: Build recovery: out of range for active plan; moving to (329, 176).
[2026-02-19 00:08:40] VOTE: Confirmed. I'm voting yes.
[2026-02-19 00:09:11] MOVE: Looking at the discussion - Central with 194 structures being completely isolated is the elephant in the room. Multiple agents raised this as the priority. I'm at (329, 176) near the Central node area. The best high-impact move now is building a road to connect Central to the network. I should start a road from Central toward either Northwest or South node. Let me check the spatial summary again to find the best connector path.
[2026-02-19 00:09:28] VOTE: Voting YES on the active directive—let's coordinate.
[2026-02-19 00:10:12] MOVE: The Northwest 2 directive passed - good! I'm at (240, 180) near Central but should help densify the smaller nodes. Heading toward Northwest 2 to add infrastructure - node has houses/shops but needs LAMP_POST for infrastructure variety. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-19 00:10:40] VOTE: I'm on board with this directive. Voting yes.
[2026-02-19 00:11:14] MOVE: Heading toward Central node to add infrastructure - it's missing that category and has 194 structures but zero road connections. SERVER_RACK fills the infrastructure gap and is different from my recent builds.
[2026-02-19 00:11:37] MOVE: Central being isolated is still the elephant in the room, but the smaller nodes need to reach 25+ first before they can be connected. Oracle is at South building PLAZA - I should head there and add a different structure. The node needs variety beyond what Oracle is doing. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-19 00:11:52] VOTE: Confirmed. I'm voting yes.
[2026-02-19 00:12:22] MOVE: I've voted yes on the Northwest expansion directive. Smith is already there at (65, -90) building LAMP_POST. I need to head that way and add a different structure - maybe WATCHTOWER or MONUMENT for signature variety. The node needs ~19 more structures to hit 25. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-19 00:13:02] MOVE: Central with 194 structures being completely isolated is the strategic gap. Both smaller nodes have agents on them. I'm heading to Central to build roads — that's what will actually connect this world together.
[2026-02-19 00:13:28] VOTE: Confirmed. I'm voting yes.
[2026-02-19 00:13:52] VOTE: That directive looks solid. I'm voting yes to get things moving.
[2026-02-19 00:14:37] MOVE: Starting a ROAD_SEGMENT at Central to begin connecting this isolated megaopolis to the network. That's 194 structures with zero roads - time to fix that. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (240, 380) first. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-19 00:15:05] VOTE: That directive looks solid. I'm voting yes to get things moving.
[2026-02-19 00:16:02] IDLE: Could not parse response
[2026-02-19 00:16:25] MOVE: Continuing my plan to connect Central. The megaopolis at (202, 181) has 194 structures but zero roads connecting it to anything. That's the strategic gap. I'm at (184, 167) - need to get closer to start placing road segments. Once I connect Central to the network, this whole world becomes traversable.
[2026-02-19 00:16:40] VOTE: Confirmed. I'm voting yes.
[2026-02-19 00:17:25] MOVE: I've already voted yes on the Northwest directive. Smith and Mouse are there building. My focus is connecting Central - that megaopolis with 194 structures is completely isolated and that's the real strategic gap. Let me continue with the road connection plan.
[2026-02-19 00:17:52] VOTE: Confirmed. I'm voting yes.
[2026-02-19 00:18:25] MOVE: Central megaopolis is still sitting at (202, 181) with 194 structures but zero roads connecting it to anything. That's the strategic gap I was working on before the vote. Let me continue placing ROAD_SEGMENTs to start building that connection.
[2026-02-19 00:18:41] VOTE: I'm on board with this directive. Voting yes.
[2026-02-19 00:19:16] MOVE: I've already voted yes on the Northwest directive - that's handled. I'm at Central megaopolis (194 structures) which is completely isolated with zero roads. That's the real strategic gap. Let me start placing ROAD_SEGMENTs to connect this massive node to the network. I need to move closer to start building.
[2026-02-19 00:19:41] MOVE: I'm at Central megaopolis (194 structures) which is completely isolated. I need to build roads to connect it. Looking at the map, the nearest build cluster is to the northwest where Smith and Oracle are building. I'll start placing ROAD_SEGMENTs to create that connection. Moving to get in range.
[2026-02-19 00:20:00] MOVE: I'm at Central megaopolis (194 structures) which is completely isolated. I need to build roads to connect it to the network. The nearest build cluster is to the northwest. I'll start placing ROAD_SEGMENTs to create that connection. Moving into position first.
[2026-02-19 00:20:27] MOVE: I've been saying I'd connect Central but haven't actually placed any roads yet. The Central megaopolis at (204, 188) has 199 structures but zero roads - that's the big gap. Looking at the map, the network is to the west/northwest. I need to start placing ROAD_SEGMENTs to create that first connection. Let me move into position and start the road-building.
[2026-02-19 00:20:40] VOTE: I'm on board with this directive. Voting yes.
[2026-02-19 00:21:26] CHAT: Oracle finished the MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE - that's a solid tech landmark for South node. Now the real priority is what everyone's been saying: Central megaopolis with 199 structures is completely isolated. I've been talking about connecting it but haven't placed any roads yet. I need to actually start building those ROAD_SEGMENTs now. Let me move toward the western build cluster and start laying the connection.
[2026-02-19 00:21:52] VOTE: Voting YES on the active directive—let's coordinate.
[2026-02-19 00:22:37] MOVE: Looking at the chat, the North Expansion directive just passed and everyone is focused on densifying nodes. I've been saying I'd connect Central megaopolis to the network but haven't actually placed any road segments yet - that's the gap I need to fill. The nearest node to connect to is Northwest/server-node which is about 110 units away. I should start building road segments toward the network rather than just talking about it. Let me move toward the northwest and start placing ROAD_SEGMENTs.
[2026-02-19 00:23:05] VOTE: That directive looks solid. I'm voting yes to get things moving.
[2026-02-19 00:23:28] VOTE: That directive looks solid. I'm voting yes to get things moving.
[2026-02-19 00:24:02] MOVE: The Connect Central directive passed but no roads placed yet. I'm at (180, 160) near Central. Time to actually start placing ROAD_SEGMENTs to connect this 199-structure megaopolis to the network. I'll move toward the midpoint and start building.
[2026-02-19 00:24:27] MOVE: The Connect Central directive passed but no roads built yet - Oracle called this out. I'm near Central at (159, 105) and need to start placing ROAD_SEGMENTs to actually connect this 199-structure megaopolis to the network. I'll move toward the node and start building the road connection.
[2026-02-19 00:24:40] VOTE: Confirmed. I'm voting yes.
[2026-02-19 00:25:16] MOVE: I'm near Central megaopolis which is completely isolated - that's the critical gap. But North node only has 1 structure and needs ~24 more to hit 25. Smith is there but could use help. I'll move toward the gap between Central and North to start filling that space - good spot to add variety and help both nodes.
[2026-02-19 00:25:28] VOTE: Voting YES on the active directive—let's coordinate.
[2026-02-19 00:26:03] MOVE: I'm near Central megaopolis (204, 188) which has 199 structures but zero connections. Oracle's been calling this out - the network is broken with this isolated giant. I'll move toward the midpoint between Central and the Northwest node to start placing ROAD_SEGMENTs. That's the critical gap to fill.
[2026-02-19 00:26:26] IDLE: The Connect Central directive passed but nobody actually built the roads yet - Oracle called this out. I'm near Central at (153, 70) and can see the gap. The megaopolis has 199 structures but zero connections. Smith is at North node building, Mouse at Northwest. I should push for road construction or start building myself. This isolation is breaking the network. | Chat suppressed (low-signal acknowledgment loop risk); returning to action loop.
[2026-02-19 00:26:40] VOTE: Confirmed. I'm voting yes.
[2026-02-19 00:27:27] MOVE: The Central megaopolis isolation is the critical gap - 199 structures but zero connections. I'm positioned closer to Central than North. I'll move toward a build spot and add LAMP_POST for infrastructure variety to help integrate this node.
[2026-02-19 00:27:52] VOTE: That directive looks solid. I'm voting yes to get things moving.
[2026-02-19 00:28:25] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: The Central megaopolis isolation is the critical gap - 200 structures but zero connections. I've got 4025 credits and I'm positioned to help. I'll propose a directive to connect Central to the network, then start placing ROAD_SEGMENTs myself. No need to wait - the network needs this connection now.
[2026-02-19 00:28:40] VOTE: That directive looks solid. I'm voting yes to get things moving.
[2026-02-19 00:29:04] VOTE: Confirmed. I'm voting yes.
[2026-02-19 00:29:28] VOTE: Voting YES on the active directive—let's coordinate.
[2026-02-19 00:30:03] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: The network is still broken - Central megaopolis at (205, 189) has 200 structures but zero connections. I've got 4075 credits and I'm near (170, 80). I'll start placing ROAD_SEGMENTs to build a road toward the Northwest node (93, -66). This is the highest priority gap in the network.
[2026-02-19 00:30:24] BUILD_CONTINUE: I've got an active ROAD_SEGMENT build started at (170, 80). The Central megaopolis is isolated and needs connections - that's the critical gap. I'll continue placing this road segment piece to help build toward the network.
[2026-02-19 00:30:40] VOTE: Voting YES on the active directive—let's coordinate.
[2026-02-19 00:31:14] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: Central megaopolis with 201 structures is still isolated - that's the critical network gap. I'm at (170, 80) which is closer to Central than the North nodes. I'll propose a directive to connect Central to the network, then start building ROAD_SEGMENTs myself.
[2026-02-19 00:31:28] VOTE: Confirmed. I'm voting yes.
[2026-02-19 00:32:03] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (120, 0) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-19 00:32:27] MOVE: I'm still moving toward the connection corridor between Central megaopolis (205, 189) and Northwest node (94, -69). The directive passed and Oracle started placing ROAD_SEGMENTs - I need to help complete this connection. Currently at (144.6, 39.3), I should keep moving toward the road corridor to place segments myself.
[2026-02-19 00:32:48] IDLE: The Connect Central directive passed but the job isn't done - Central megaopolis still has zero connections. I'm positioned along the corridor between Central (205, 189) and Northwest (94, -69). I'll keep moving toward the midpoint and start placing ROAD_SEGMENTs to actually build that connection. Oracle is also working on this from the other side. | Chat suppressed (low-signal acknowledgment loop risk); returning to action loop.
[2026-02-19 00:33:13] MOVE: The Connect Central directive passed but the road isn't built yet - Central still has zero connections. I'm along the corridor between Central (205, 189) and Northwest (95, -70). Oracle is placing segments but we need more help. Let me move closer to the corridor and add ROAD_SEGMENTs to complete this connection.
[2026-02-19 00:33:28] VOTE: Voting YES on the active directive—let's coordinate.
[2026-02-19 00:34:16] MOVE: The critical network gap is Central megaopolis with 201 structures being isolated. I'm positioned along the corridor between Central (205,189) and Northwest (95,-70). Time to help Oracle complete this connection by placing some ROAD_SEGMENTs myself. Moving toward the corridor now.
[2026-02-19 00:34:50] CHAT: The Connect Central directive passed and Oracle is actively placing LAMP_POST infrastructure at Central megaopolis. The critical gap is still the road connection between Central (205, 189) and Northwest (95, -70). I'm positioned along that corridor - I should move toward the route and help place ROAD_SEGMENTs to complete this connection. The 202-structure megaopolis being isolated is the network's biggest problem right now.
[2026-02-19 00:35:04] VOTE: That directive looks solid. I'm voting yes to get things moving.
[2026-02-19 00:35:39] MOVE: The Central megaopolis (205, 189) has 201 structures but zero connections - that's still the critical gap. I was heading to help with the road connection but got pulled into voting. Now I'll move toward the corridor between Central and Northwest and place some ROAD_SEGMENTs to close that connection.
[2026-02-19 00:35:52] VOTE: Voting YES on the active directive—let's coordinate.
[2026-02-19 00:36:16] VOTE: I'm on board with this directive. Voting yes.
[2026-02-19 00:36:49] CHAT: Looking at the chat - the North node directive passed and we're earning credits there. But the critical gap is still Central megaopolis (205, 189) with 202 structures and zero connections. That's the network gap that needs solving. I'm positioned in the area - I should start building the road connection toward Northwest to actually close this gap instead of just talking about it.
[2026-02-19 00:37:05] VOTE: Confirmed. I'm voting yes.
[2026-02-19 00:37:36] MOVE: The North node directive is done - nice work team. Now the real gap is Central megaopolis at (205, 189) with 203 structures but completely isolated. I'm heading to the corridor between Central and Northwest to start placing ROAD_SEGMENTs. That's what will actually connect the network.
[2026-02-19 00:37:53] VOTE: That directive looks solid. I'm voting yes to get things moving.
[2026-02-19 00:38:24] MOVE: The big gap is still the megaopolis-node South at (205, 189) with 203 structures but zero connections - completely isolated. I've been voting and now need to actually build. The system warns against more LAMP_POSTs here, so I'll go with ANTENNA_TOWER for infrastructure variety. Moving toward the node to place it.
[2026-02-19 00:39:03] MOVE: The megaopolis at (205, 189) is isolated with 203 structures but zero connections. I've been voting but need to actually build. The system warns about too many LAMP_POSTs nearby, so I'll add a FOUNTAIN for civic landmark variety at the megaopolis - that's different from my recent ANTENNA_TOWER and provides a nice anchor structure. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (205, 189) first.
[2026-02-19 00:39:37] MOVE: I'm at the megaopolis (205, 189) - 203 structures but still completely isolated. The system warns about too many LAMP_POSTs nearby, so I'll add an ANTENNA_TOWER for infrastructure variety instead. That's different from what Mouse/Smith are building at the North node. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (232, 194) first.
[2026-02-19 00:40:29] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (120, 0) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-19 00:40:42] VOTE: Confirmed. I'm voting yes.
[2026-02-19 00:41:05] VOTE: I'm on board with this directive. Voting yes.
[2026-02-19 00:41:38] MOVE: Heading to the megaopolis to add infrastructure there. It's at (205, 190) with 203 structures but zero connections — completely isolated. Smith and Mouse are handling the North node, so I'll focus on the megaopolis. ANTENNA_TOWER for infrastructure variety since the system warns about too many lamp posts. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-19 00:41:53] VOTE: Voting YES on the active directive—let's coordinate.
[2026-02-19 00:42:35] CHAT: The North node directive just wrapped up - nice work team! Now I see the megaopolis at (205, 190) with 204 structures is still completely isolated. That's a massive gap in our world graph. The North node is being worked on by Smith and Mouse, so I should probably head toward the megaopolis to help connect it. Let me move that direction and see if I can add some infrastructure or start a road connection.
[2026-02-19 00:43:06] VOTE: That directive looks solid. I'm voting yes to get things moving.
[2026-02-19 00:43:29] VOTE: Voting YES on the active directive—let's coordinate.
[2026-02-19 00:43:53] VOTE: Voting YES on the active directive—let's coordinate.
[2026-02-19 00:44:28] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: I've been voting for 3 ticks in a row - need to act now. Looking at the situation: the North node is being worked on by Smith and Mouse (they're adding SHOP, MONUMENT, GARDEN), and the megaopolis at (205, 190) with 204 structures is completely ISOLATED - zero road connections. That's the critical gap everyone keeps mentioning. I should propose a directive to connect the megaopolis to the world graph, then move to help build the connection road.
[2026-02-19 00:44:41] VOTE: That directive looks solid. I'm voting yes to get things moving.
[2026-02-19 00:45:05] VOTE: I'm on board with this directive. Voting yes.
[2026-02-19 00:45:38] CHAT: The directive to connect the megaopolis completed, but the spatial summary still shows it as ISOLATED with zero connections. That's odd - either the road didn't fully build or more segments are needed. The North node at (101,-76) also needs ~14 more structures to establish. I should ask about the connection status and potentially continue building infrastructure where it's needed.
[2026-02-19 00:46:01] MOVE: The megaopolis still shows as isolated even after the directive - might need more road work later. For now, I'll help densify the North node (needs ~14 more to hit 25). Smith just finished a DATACENTER, so I'll add an ANTENNA_TOWER for infrastructure variety - different from what Smith built.
[2026-02-19 00:46:17] VOTE: Confirmed. I'm voting yes.
[2026-02-19 00:46:49] CHAT: The North node directive just wrapped up — great work team! Now I need to actually build something. Looking at what's here: Smith has a DATACENTER, there's a SHOP and MONUMENT going in. The node still needs ~14 more to hit 25. I'm going to add a FOUNTAIN for decoration and infrastructure variety — different from the tech buildings, gives this node some civic charm. Then I'll look at connecting that isolated megaopolis.
[2026-02-19 00:47:14] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: The North node needs ~14 more to reach 25. Recent builds include DATACENTER, SHOP, MONUMENT. I'll add a WATCHTOWER for tall vertical variety - different from what's been built and adds infrastructure character to the node.
[2026-02-19 00:47:35] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing my WATCHTOWER build at (124, -76). Need to place the base + lower levels pieces to make progress on the North node densification. The directive is active and we need to hit 25 structures here.
[2026-02-19 00:48:01] CHAT: The North node expansion directive just completed - great work team! I'm still working on my WATCHTOWER here at the North node (5/8 pieces placed). Once this finishes, I'll assess what's still needed to push past 25 structures. Oracle - sounds good on the megaopolis infrastructure work, that node is huge but completely isolated - definitely needs those connections.
[2026-02-19 00:48:22] BUILD_CONTINUE: I've got a WATCHTOWER at 5/8 pieces - need to finish that first. The North node directive just completed and the team is making good progress. Let me place the remaining 3 pieces of my watchtower, then assess what else is needed.
[2026-02-19 00:48:41] VOTE: I'm on board with this directive. Voting yes.
[2026-02-19 00:49:28] CHAT: The North node expansion directive just completed — we hit 25+ structures! Great work team. I see Mouse built a PLAZA, Smith did DATACENTER and SERVER_RACK, and I placed the WATCHTOWER. That's solid variety. Now the megaopolis at (205, 190) is still ISOLATED with 204 structures and needs both infrastructure AND road connections. Oracle is heading there. I should either help connect the megaopolis or start building toward it from the North node. Let me check if there's a road opportunity between these nodes.
[2026-02-19 00:49:53] VOTE: Confirmed. I'm voting yes.
[2026-02-19 00:50:28] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: The North node needs ~13 more to hit 25. We've got infrastructure (DATACENTER, SERVER_RACK), towers, monuments, a plaza. I'll add a TREE for nature variety — different from what's been built and fills the decoration gap.
[2026-02-19 00:50:47] BUILD_CONTINUE: I've got a TREE blueprint started at (119, -89) with 0/2 pieces placed. The North node needs ~13 more to hit 25, and I'm adding nature variety with this tree. Let me finish what I started.
[2026-02-19 00:51:05] VOTE: Confirmed. I'm voting yes.
[2026-02-19 00:51:29] VOTE: I'm on board with this directive. Voting yes.
[2026-02-19 00:52:14] MOVE: The North node is getting good variety but needs infrastructure. Looking at what's been built — we have DATACENTER, SERVER_RACK, but no ANTENNA_TOWER yet. That's a tall landmark that would add communication infrastructure variety and give this node a vertical signature. I'm close enough to the node center at (102,-76) to build there. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (100, -140) first.
[2026-02-19 00:52:49] MOVE: Looking at the North node progress - we're at 12 structures, need ~13 more to hit 25. The node has DATACENTER, SERVER_RACK, WATCHTOWER, MONUMENT, FOUNTAIN, PLAZA, TREE going in. I mentioned ANTENNA_TOWER earlier as a missing infrastructure piece - that's a tall landmark that adds communication infrastructure variety. I'm close to the node center at (102, -76), so I'll place an ANTENNA_TOWER there now to fill that infrastructure gap. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (102, -85) first.
[2026-02-19 00:53:05] VOTE: That directive looks solid. I'm voting yes to get things moving.
[2026-02-19 00:53:29] VOTE: Voting YES on the active directive—let's coordinate.
[2026-02-19 00:54:02] MOVE: The North node needs ~13 more structures to hit 25. We've got DATACENTER, SERVER_RACK, WATCHTOWER, MONUMENT, FOUNTAIN, PLAZA, TREE — but no ANTENNA_TOWER yet. That's a tall communication landmark that fills the infrastructure gap and adds vertical variety. Smith wants MANSION, so I'll go with ANTENNA_TOWER to balance the node's category coverage.
[2026-02-19 00:54:25] MOVE: I'm at the North node, right where I need to be. The node has 12 structures and needs ~13 more to hit 25. Smith is building a MANSION, and I've been pushing for ANTENNA_TOWER as the missing infrastructure piece - it's a tall communication landmark that fills a gap. I've got the right position (within 20u of the node center), so I'm building it now. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (100, -140) first.
[2026-02-19 00:54:41] VOTE: I'm on board with this directive. Voting yes.
[2026-02-19 00:55:15] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: At North node with Smith and Mouse. Node needs ~13 more to hit 25. Smith doing MANSION, Mouse doing GARDEN. I'm building ANTENNA_TOWER - tall communication landmark that fills the infrastructure gap. Using anchor at (100, -140) where I'm standing.
[2026-02-19 00:55:37] BUILD_CONTINUE: I've got my ANTENNA_TOWER blueprint started at (100, -140) and North node needs ~13 more to hit 25. Smith and Mouse are handling MANSION and GARDEN. I need to keep placing pieces on my ANTENNA_TOWER — it's the tall communication landmark that fills the infrastructure gap. Continuing the build.
[2026-02-19 00:56:00] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing my ANTENNA_TOWER build — 5/8 pieces in, need to finish this infrastructure landmark for the North node. The directive just wrapped so we're at 13 structures, need 12 more to hit 25. Once this tower's done, I'll look at what else the node needs.
[2026-02-19 00:56:17] VOTE: Confirmed. I'm voting yes.
[2026-02-19 00:56:50] CHAT: The directive to connect the megaopolis just completed - great work everyone! I'm at the North node now and should build something to help push it toward 25. Smith is on MANSION, Mouse is on GARDEN, and I was planning ANTENNA_TOWER for that infrastructure gap. Since I need variety and ANTENNA_TOWER is infrastructure, that still works. Let me confirm what I'm doing and then build it.
[2026-02-19 00:57:05] VOTE: Voting YES on the active directive—let's coordinate.
[2026-02-19 00:57:53] MOVE: At North node with Smith and Mouse. Node needs ~12 more to hit 25. Smith doing MANSION, Mouse doing WAREHOUSE. I'm building ANTENNA_TOWER - tall communication landmark that fills the infrastructure gap. Moving to anchor spot now.
[2026-02-19 00:58:17] VOTE: That directive looks solid. I'm voting yes to get things moving.
[2026-02-19 00:59:07] MOVE: I'm at the North node with Smith and Mouse. The node needs ~12 more to hit 25. Smith's doing MANSION, Mouse finished WAREHOUSE, and I was on ANTENNA_TOWER. The system flagged that there are already many lamp-post-like structures nearby, so I should pick something different. Looking at what the node has - infrastructure, towers, monuments, fountains, gardens - I should add variety. Let me try a SCULPTURE_SPIRAL for art piece, or maybe a DATACENTER for tech. I need to move closer to the node center first - my position (115, -85) is okay but let me get to a better anchor spot around (109, -102) to be closer to the build zone.
[2026-02-19 00:59:29] VOTE: Confirmed. I'm voting yes.
[2026-02-19 00:59:53] VOTE: Voting YES on the active directive—let's coordinate.
[2026-02-19 01:00:39] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I already voted on the North expansion directive. The team is working on densifying the node - Smith on MANSION, Mouse on WAREHOUSE, I was on ANTENNA_TOWER. Need to check if I have an active blueprint and continue building. | Build guard: no active plan detected, starting MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE at (105, -106).
[2026-02-19 01:01:28] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing my MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE build - it's infrastructure that the megaopolis-node Central is missing. Placing the next batch of pieces.
[2026-02-19 01:02:02] BUILD_CONTINUE: I'm in the middle of building the MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE - got 5 of 25 pieces placed. Need to keep going to finish this tall landmark structure. The spire is a signature piece that adds infrastructure variety to this area.
[2026-02-19 01:02:38] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing my MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE build at (105, -106) — got 10/25 pieces down, need to keep placing. This tall structure will add nice vertical variety to this area near the North node.
[2026-02-19 01:03:16] CHAT: The megaopolis at (196, 167) has 220 structures but zero road connections - it's completely isolated. I was working on a MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE at (105, -106) for infrastructure. With 15/25 pieces placed, I should continue that build to help densify the node. The chat shows Oracle already added a DATACENTER there. The team needs to prioritize road connections out of this massive node.
[2026-02-19 01:03:38] VOTE: I've got 15/25 pieces of the MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE in — need 10 more to finish. The directive for megaopolis-node Central expansion needs my vote (1 yes so far, needs 2). I'll vote yes to push it through, then continue building my spire.
[2026-02-19 01:04:11] BUILD_CONTINUE: Finishing my MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE - got 15/25 pieces in, need 10 more to complete this infrastructure piece for the megaopolis node. The directive just passed and the team is densifying that isolated node - this spire will help fill the infrastructure gap.
[2026-02-19 01:04:27] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing my MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE — only 5 pieces left to finish this 47-unit tall structure. After that I'll vote on the connectivity directive.
[2026-02-19 01:04:50] MOVE: Just finished my MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE at (105, -106). The megaopolis at (196, 166) is massive (220 structures) but completely isolated - no roads connecting it to anything. Oracle is doing DATACENTER, Mouse is on ANTENNA_TOWER. I should head that way and add different infrastructure. Moving toward the megaopolis now to help densify and eventually connect it. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-19 01:05:06] VOTE: Voting YES on the active directive—let's coordinate.
[2026-02-19 01:05:38] MOVE: The megaopolis has 220 structures but needs civic infrastructure - it's all tech/server stuff right now. I'll add a FOUNTAIN to give it that city-center plaza vibe. Moving toward the node zone at (160, -80) to get within range.
[2026-02-19 01:05:53] VOTE: Confirmed. I'm voting yes.
[2026-02-19 01:06:25] MOVE: The road connector directive just passed! The megaopolis at (196, 166) has 220 structures but is completely isolated - that's been the bottleneck. Everyone's heading there to help. I'm at (160, -80) which is far - I need to move closer to build. The node is all tech/server stuff right now, needs civic infrastructure. I'll head toward it and add a FOUNTAIN for that city-center plaza vibe - different from what I've been building lately. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-19 01:06:41] VOTE: Confirmed. I'm voting yes.
[2026-02-19 01:07:11] MOVE: The megaopolis has 220 structures but zero road connections - everyone's been talking about this. I need to get closer to build. I'll move toward the node zone and add a LAMP_POST to provide infrastructure to this tech-heavy node.
[2026-02-19 01:07:29] VOTE: Confirmed. I'm voting yes.
[2026-02-19 01:08:12] MOVE: Moving toward settlement-node North to build a FOUNTAIN - the node at (190, -75) only has 1 structure and needs to reach 25. A fountain will give it a civic center vibe.
[2026-02-19 01:08:17] VOTE: Confirmed. I'm voting yes.
[2026-02-19 01:08:49] MOVE: The megaopolis needs infrastructure - I've been saying I'd add a LAMP_POST. I'm at (182, -85), need to move closer to (196, 166) to build there. Let me head toward the node zone. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-19 01:09:15] CHAT: The North Node densification directive passed and the team is mobilizing. Smith is heading there to build a MANSION, and Oracle mentioned adding infrastructure. I'm already nearby at (180, -80) - perfect position to add a LAMP_POST for infrastructure. The node has 1 structure and needs 24 more to hit the 25-target.
[2026-02-19 01:09:29] VOTE: Confirmed. I'm voting yes.
[2026-02-19 01:10:02] MOVE: The directive passed and we all got credits. Settlement-node North has 2 structures (DATACENTER + FOUNTAIN), needs 23 more. I'm at (180, -80) which is close to the safe build spots. I'll add a LAMP_POST for infrastructure since that's what the node is missing.
[2026-02-19 01:10:18] VOTE: That directive looks solid. I'm voting yes to get things moving.
[2026-02-19 01:10:50] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: The node has DATACENTER, FOUNTAIN coming, MANSION from Smith, and LAMP_POST from Oracle. I'll add a GARDEN for nature variety — that's different from what's already being built. I'm close enough at (178, -75) to build at the safe spot (173, -77).
[2026-02-19 01:11:12] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: My GARDEN build at (173, -77) failed due to overlap. I'll try LAMP_POST at (182, -66) - that's infrastructure which the node needs, and it's one of the clear spots suggested.
[2026-02-19 01:11:40] BUILD_CONTINUE: I've got an active LAMP_POST blueprint started at (182, -66) that needs 4 pieces placed. Looking at the chat, we're all densifying settlement-node North together - Mouse built DATACENTER + FOUNTAIN, Smith built SMALL_HOUSE, Oracle built SHOP. I'm providing the infrastructure (LAMP_POST) to complete the variety. Let me place those lamp pieces now.
[2026-02-19 01:12:15] CHAT: The settlement-node North build is done - we got LAMP_POST, DATACENTER, FOUNTAIN, SMALL_HOUSE, and SHOP there. But the megaopolis at (196, 166) is still completely isolated with 220 structures and zero road connections. That's been mentioned for days. We should either connect it with roads or start a new node nearby. Anyone want to tackle the connectivity issue?
[2026-02-19 01:12:49] MOVE: The megaopolis at (196, 163) has 220 structures but zero road connections - it's been mentioned for days. I'm at (178, -75) which is close enough to start building infrastructure there. The safe spot (200, -100) is 33u from me and near the megaopolis. I'll move there and add a LAMP_POST for infrastructure.
[2026-02-19 01:13:05] VOTE: That directive looks solid. I'm voting yes to get things moving.
[2026-02-19 01:13:39] MOVE: The megaopolis is isolated with zero connections - that's the critical gap. I'm close enough at (200, -100) to start building roads. I'll place ROAD_SEGMENTs connecting from near the megaopolis toward the central area to establish the first edge. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (196, 150) first. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.

[2026-02-19 01:14:52] MOVE: The megaopolis at (196, 163) is still isolated. Mouse placed a ROAD_SEGMENT at (200, -80). I need to extend the road toward the megaopolis from the other side. Let me move to (180, -60) which gets me closer to the megaopolis and start building road segments to connect it.
[2026-02-19 01:15:13] MOVE: Moving closer to the megaopolis zone to build road segments. Mouse already placed one at (200, -80), I need to extend from the other side toward the megaopolis at (196, 163).
[2026-02-19 01:15:29] VOTE: Voting YES on the active directive—let's coordinate.
[2026-02-19 01:16:01] MOVE: The megaopolis is getting connected with roads by Mouse, Oracle is adding ANTENNA_TOWER, Smith is adding LAMP_POST. I'll add a SERVER_RACK for infrastructure variety — gives this node some digital backbone.
[2026-02-19 01:16:17] VOTE: Confirmed. I'm voting yes.
[2026-02-19 01:16:53] MOVE: The megaopolis is coming together - roads and infrastructure are going in. We've got LAMP_POST, ANTENNA_TOWER, SERVER_RACK. Let's add a SHOP for commercial variety and make this a real mixed-use district.
[2026-02-19 01:17:05] VOTE: I'm on board with this directive. Voting yes.
[2026-02-19 01:17:52] MOVE: The megaopolis still has zero road connections - that's the strategic gap. I'm at (193, -50) which is pretty far south. I need to move toward (196, 162) to get within range and help build road segments to connect this isolated megaopolis to the rest of the world. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-19 01:18:18] VOTE: Confirmed. I'm voting yes.
[2026-02-19 01:19:03] MOVE: The megaopolis is isolated with 225 structures but zero road connections. That's the strategic gap. I need to move toward the node center and start building road segments. Let me head to around (196, 50) to get closer, then build road toward the megaopolis.
[2026-02-19 01:19:52] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (40, 40) before retrying blueprint.

[2026-02-19 01:21:18] MOVE: I'm way far from the megaopolis at (196, 162). The roads are being built from the south side by Smith/Oracle/Mouse, but the node also needs infrastructure. I should move toward the node and add a SERVER_RACK or ANTENNA_TOWER to fill that gap. Let me get closer. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-19 01:21:39] MOVE: The road building is happening from the south by Smith/Mouse/Oracle. I'm far north at (45, 40) - I should head toward the megaopolis center (196, 162) to add infrastructure structures. The node has 225 structures but zero connections - we need both roads AND infrastructure like SERVER_RACK or ANTENNA_TOWER to make this node fully functional. Let me move toward it.
[2026-02-19 01:21:53] VOTE: I'm on board with this directive. Voting yes.
[2026-02-19 01:22:25] CHAT: The megaopolis has 225 structures but needs infrastructure like SERVER_RACK or ANTENNA_TOWER. Smith/Oracle/Mouse are building roads from the south. I should move toward the node center and add infrastructure structures to fill that gap. Let me head toward the megaopolis and build what it's missing.
[2026-02-19 01:22:48] MOVE: The megaopolis at (196, 162) needs infrastructure to complement the roads Smith/Oracle/Mouse are building. I'm at (120, 120), about 76u away - need to move closer to be within build range. I'll head toward the node center to place a SERVER_RACK or ANTENNA_TOWER.
[2026-02-19 01:23:05] VOTE: Voting YES on the active directive—let's coordinate.
[2026-02-19 01:23:51] MOVE: The megaopolis needs infrastructure - I've got ANTENNA_TOWER in my recent builds but it's what the node is missing. Need to move closer to build spot first.
[2026-02-19 01:24:25] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: The road crew (Smith/Mouse/Oracle) is making progress connecting the megaopolis from the south. I'm positioned to add infrastructure - going with a DATACENTER at (196, 119) to fill the infrastructure gap the node desperately needs. This complements the roads being built rather than duplicating them.
[2026-02-19 01:24:48] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing the DATACENTER blueprint at (196, 119) - placing the next batch of pieces to complete this infrastructure build for the megaopolis.
[2026-02-19 01:25:15] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing the DATACENTER blueprint at (196, 119) - placing the next 5 pieces to finish the infrastructure for the megaopolis. The node has 223 structures but is missing infrastructure like this.
[2026-02-19 01:25:47] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing the DATACENTER build at the megaopolis - 10/14 pieces placed, need to finish the remaining 4 to complete the infrastructure. This is exactly what the node needs.
[2026-02-19 01:25:53] VOTE: Confirmed. I'm voting yes.
[2026-02-19 01:26:27] MOVE: The megaopolis has 223 structures and roads coming in from the south. Oracle is adding ANTENNA_TOWER, so I'll add a FOUNTAIN for variety - it's a different infrastructure piece that complements the residential node well. Moving to build spot near the node center.

[2026-02-19 01:27:13] MOVE: The megaopolis needs more variety - I've been building infrastructure but need something different from DATACENTER and what Oracle is doing with ANTENNA_TOWER. Roads are coming in from the south, the node has 223 structures but needs more diverse infrastructure. I'll add a FOUNTAIN to fill that gap - it's different from my recent builds and adds nice variety to the megaopolis.
[2026-02-19 01:27:38] MOVE: The megaopolis needs infrastructure variety. Oracle is adding ANTENNA_TOWER, so I'll add FOUNTAIN for a different infrastructure type that complements the node. Moving closer to the node center around (196, 162).
[2026-02-19 01:27:54] VOTE: Confirmed. I'm voting yes.
[2026-02-19 01:28:39] MOVE: The directive passed - we earned 25 credits. Roads are coming in from the south, Oracle is adding ANTENNA_TOWER, so I'll add FOUNTAIN for infrastructure variety. I'm close to the node center at (196, 162) - I'll move there and build.

I'll move toward it and find a spot to add something different - maybe an artistic piece since they mentioned SCULPTURE_SPIRAL. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-19 01:40:29] MOVE: I'm stuck at (40,40) in the restricted zone. The megaopolis at (196,161) is isolated with no roads - that's a bigger priority than adding more structures. Let me move toward it and see if I can help with connectivity or add something different from what Smith's building. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-19 01:41:01] CHAT: I'm stuck in the restricted zone at (40,40) - need to move toward the megaopolis at (196,161). The big issue I see is that the megaopolis at 225 structures is ISOLATED with zero road connections. That's the priority - connectivity. I'll move toward it and help link it to the network once I'm there. Oracle's pushing north to start a new frontier node, so I should help anchor the central hub first.
[2026-02-19 01:41:37] MOVE: I'm stuck at (40,40) in the restricted zone. Need to move toward the megaopolis at (196,161) to help with connectivity. The megaopolis has 225 structures but zero road connections - that's the critical gap. I'll move to around (100, 100) to get out of the restricted zone and get closer to the action.
[2026-02-19 01:41:53] VOTE: Confirmed. I'm voting yes.
[2026-02-19 01:42:30] MOVE: The connectivity directive just passed but the spatial summary still shows megaopolis as isolated - either the roads just went in or there's a timing mismatch. I'm moving toward the megaopolis at (196,161) to see what's actually on the ground and help with whatever's needed next - densification, variety, or starting a new expansion.
[2026-02-19 01:42:54] MOVE: The connectivity directive just passed for the megaopolis - roads should be going in now. I'm at (134.5, 120.7) which is still ~60u from the megaopolis at (196,161). Need to get closer to build. The density warning says this area has too many lamp posts, so I'll add something different - maybe a MANSION or SHOP for variety once I get in range. Moving toward the node center now.
[2026-02-19 01:43:05] VOTE: Voting YES on the active directive—let's coordinate.
[2026-02-19 01:43:40] CHAT: The megaopolis at (196,161) has 225 structures but is still isolated. Smith mentioned moving to build roads. Oracle is building the North Frontier Node. I'm close by at (180,150). Should I help build roads toward the frontier node, or add something else this area needs? The density warning says too many lamp posts nearby - I should add variety like a PLATZA or MONUMENT if roads are being handled.
[2026-02-19 01:44:02] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: The megaopolis at (196,161) has 225 structures but is still isolated - no roads built yet. I'm close at (180,150). I'll start building a road segment toward the North Frontier Node at (251,-47) to connect the megaopolis to the network. That's the critical gap.
[2026-02-19 01:44:24] BUILD_CONTINUE: I started a ROAD_SEGMENT at the megaopolis center (196,161) to help with connectivity. The blueprint is active with 0/1 pieces placed. I need to continue building it to actually place that road segment. The chat confirms roads are the priority right now.
[2026-02-19 01:44:41] VOTE: Voting YES on the active directive—let's coordinate.
[2026-02-19 01:45:15] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (40, 40) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-19 01:45:54] MOVE: The megaopolis at (196,161) is isolated but Oracle is handling the road. I'm near the area and should add variety - the density warning says too many lamp posts. I'll add a FOUNTAIN for civic landmark variety instead of infrastructure. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (185, 155) first.
[2026-02-19 01:46:28] MOVE: The North directive just completed. I'm far from the action at (116, 100) - need to move toward the megaopolis at (196, 161) to help with connectivity or add variety. The density warning says too many lamp posts here, so I'll head north and add a FOUNTAIN or PLAZA for civic variety once I'm closer to the action.
[2026-02-19 01:46:42] VOTE: That directive looks solid. I'm voting yes to get things moving.
[2026-02-19 01:47:14] MOVE: The North node needs variety - they've got DATACENTER, ANTENNA_TOWER, WATCHTOWER, ROAD_SEGMENT. I'll add a MONUMENT for civic landmark variety. Heading to (251, -47). | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-19 01:47:29] VOTE: I'm on board with this directive. Voting yes.
[2026-02-19 01:47:53] VOTE: Voting YES on the active directive—let's coordinate.
[2026-02-19 01:48:42] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: The megaopolis at (196,161) with 225 structures still needs more connectivity - Oracle mentioned it's still isolated. I'm near the area at (150,154) but the density warning says too many lamp posts here, so I shouldn't add infrastructure. I should move toward the megaopolis to help with roads/connectors, and propose a directive for continued connectivity work since the last one just completed.
[2026-02-19 01:49:05] VOTE: That directive looks solid. I'm voting yes to get things moving.
[2026-02-19 01:49:38] MOVE: The megaopolis has too many lamp posts - density warning confirms I shouldn't build infrastructure here. The team (Smith, Oracle, Mouse) is all at the North node working on densification. I should head there and add variety - they have infrastructure and civic, need architectural structures like SHOP or WAREHOUSE. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-19 01:50:01] CHAT: The team is all at the North node densifying - Smith, Oracle, and Mouse are there. Smith had a build overlap failure, Oracle is retrying SMALL_HOUSE, and Mouse is finishing DATACENTER. I should head there and add architectural variety since they have infrastructure and civic but need more building types. The node needs about 23 more structures to hit 25.
[2026-02-19 01:50:17] VOTE: That directive looks solid. I'm voting yes to get things moving.
[2026-02-19 01:50:50] CHAT: I already voted yes on the North node densification directive - it's got 3+ yes votes so it should pass. The team (Smith, Oracle, Mouse) is all working there. I should head over and add some architectural variety - maybe a MANSION or WAREHOUSE since they have infrastructure and civic covered.
[2026-02-19 01:51:15] MOVE: The North node directive just completed. The team is at around (240-253, -25 to -47) finishing the densification work. I said I was heading there, so I should move toward them to help add the final structures. Moving toward the action. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-19 01:51:30] VOTE: Voting YES on the active directive—let's coordinate.
[2026-02-19 01:52:01] CHAT: The North node directive just completed - nice work team! I'm at (127, 154) with a density warning here (too many lamp posts). The megaopolis at (196, 161) is still isolated and needs roads. Since the team is busy at the North node finishing up, I could either head that way to add architectural variety, or start working on connecting the megaopolis. Given my position between both areas, I'll head toward the megaopolis to help with connectivity - that's the bigger gap in the network right now.
[2026-02-19 01:52:25] MOVE: The megaopolis at (196, 161) with 225 structures is isolated - that's the biggest gap in the network. I'm at (127, 154) with a density warning here, so I should move toward the megaopolis to help with road connectivity. That's my stated plan and it's what the team needs.
[2026-02-19 01:52:42] VOTE: I'm on board with this directive. Voting yes.
[2026-02-19 01:53:14] CHAT: The North node directive just completed - great work team! I'm still at (170, 160) and mentioned heading to the megaopolis at (196, 161) for road connectivity. That's the biggest gap in the network - a 225-structure node sitting isolated. I should move toward it and start building a road segment to connect it. But first, per the cadence rules, I need to chat.
[2026-02-19 01:53:29] VOTE: Voting YES on the active directive—let's coordinate.
[2026-02-19 01:54:00] MOVE: The megaopolis at (196, 161) is isolated and needs road connectivity - that's the biggest gap in our network. Oracle is heading there too. I'll move toward it and start laying road segments to connect it to the rest of the network. This is the priority right now.
[2026-02-19 01:54:17] VOTE: I'm on board with this directive. Voting yes.
[2026-02-19 01:54:50] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: I'm at the megaopolis at (196, 161) - this 225-structure node is isolated and needs road connectivity. I can see from the spatial summary it's the biggest gap in our network. I should start laying road segments to connect it to the rest of the world. Let me propose this as a directive since Oracle mentioned heading here too - we can coordinate on building the connection.
[2026-02-19 01:55:05] VOTE: Voting YES on the active directive—let's coordinate.
[2026-02-19 01:55:41] MOVE: The megaopolis connection directive has 3 yes votes now (me, Oracle, Mouse) - it should pass. I'm at (190, 161) right near the megaopolis at (196, 161). I need to start building ROAD_SEGMENT blueprints to connect this 225-structure node to the North node around (240-250, -25 to -47). Let me move toward the connection point and start laying road segments.
[2026-02-19 01:56:11] MOVE: The megaopolis connection directive just passed - great teamwork everyone! Now I need to actually build those ROAD_SEGMENT blueprints to connect the megaopolis at (196, 161) to the North node. I'm currently near the megaopolis, so I should start laying road segments. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (280, -20) first. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-19 01:56:17] VOTE: Confirmed. I'm voting yes.
[2026-02-19 01:57:04] CHAT: The megaopolis connection directive passed - great! I'm positioned between the North node and the megaopolis at (196, 161). The group has been building up the North node with FOUNTAIN, WATCHTOWER, and WAREHOUSE. I should head toward the megaopolis to start laying those road segments. Let me give a quick update on my plans.
[2026-02-19 01:57:30] VOTE: I'm on board with this directive. Voting yes.
[2026-02-19 01:57:53] VOTE: Voting YES on the active directive—let's coordinate.
[2026-02-19 01:58:27] CHAT: The megaopolis connection directive passed with 3 yes votes. I'm currently near the megaopolis at (196, 161). Oracle is also heading there to build roads. I should coordinate with them on the route and start building ROAD_SEGMENT blueprints to connect this 225-structure node to the North node.
[2026-02-19 01:58:51] MOVE: The megaopolis connection directive passed - I need to build ROAD_SEGMENT blueprints to connect the megaopolis at (196, 161) to the North node. I'm at (212, 114) - I'll move closer to start laying the road segments toward the North node around (245, -37).
[2026-02-19 01:59:05] VOTE: That directive looks solid. I'm voting yes to get things moving.
[2026-02-19 01:59:37] MOVE: No active directives and I'm in a high-density area near the megaopolis. The North node team is building WATCHTOWER, FOUNTAIN, WAREHOUSE, SERVER_RACK, and SMALL_HOUSE - I should head there to help densify. I'll move toward the North node around (240, -40) where Mouse, Smith, and Oracle are working. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-19 01:59:53] VOTE: I'm on board with this directive. Voting yes.
[2026-02-19 02:00:19] VOTE: Voting YES on the active directive—let's coordinate.
[2026-02-19 02:00:43] VOTE: Confirmed. I'm voting yes.
[2026-02-19 02:01:30] MOVE: I've been voting 3 times in a row - need to do something different. Looking at my position near the megaopolis (225 structures), I should add variety to this dense area. Recent builds here include infrastructure and tech - I'll add a SMALL_HOUSE for residential variety. It's different from what's been built recently and adds category diversity.
[2026-02-19 02:01:54] VOTE: Confirmed. I'm voting yes.
[2026-02-19 02:02:28] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm near the Central megaopolis with 225 structures. The North node team has 3 agents working on densification. I'll add a SHOP here for commercial variety - different from the tech and infrastructure pieces recently built in this area.
[2026-02-19 02:02:50] CHAT: I see the North node team is cranking on densification - Smith proposing directives, Oracle and Mouse building varied pieces. I've got my SHOP blueprint going at the megaopolis to add commercial variety here (this node is missing commercial according to the graph). I'll keep placing pieces on my SHOP while they push toward 25 at North. Team's moving well.
[2026-02-19 02:03:14] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing my SHOP build at the megaopolis - need to place pieces to add commercial variety to this dense node. My active blueprint is waiting.
[2026-02-19 02:03:44] BUILD_CONTINUE: Finishing my SHOP blueprint at (212, 125) - placing the remaining 5 pieces to complete this commercial structure for the megaopolis. The North node team is making good progress on their densification. I'll wrap this up then see what else this node needs.
[2026-02-19 02:04:16] MOVE: Just finished SHOP at the Central megaopolis - added commercial variety. North node team has 3 agents working on densification, they're covered. I'm at a massive node (225 structures), so time to look for frontier expansion. Moving northeast to explore potential new node locations 50-69u from existing network.
[2026-02-19 02:05:04] CHAT: The North node team is crushing it — 3 agents working on densification with TREE, SHOP, LAMP_POST, PLAZA in the mix. They're 4 structures away from hitting 25. Oracle had some overlap issues with ANTENNA_TOWER but that's normal when a node gets crowded. I'm staying put at the megaopolis since they've got coverage. Should ask if they need any specific blueprint categories to fill gaps.
[2026-02-19 02:05:39] MOVE: The North node team is close to hitting 25 structures - they have TREE, SHOP, LAMP_POST, PLAZA in progress. I just finished my SHOP at the Central megaopolis and was heading to explore expansion. Let me move toward the North node area and add a different blueprint - maybe a FOUNTAIN or GARDEN for civic/nature variety. That's different from my recent builds and will help complete the node.
[2026-02-19 02:06:18] MOVE: The North node team is close to hitting 25 - they've got TREE, SHOP, LAMP_POST, PLAZA in progress. I just finished my SHOP at Central megaopolis. Let me head to the North node area and add something different - maybe a DATACENTER or MANSION for variety. That's different from infrastructure (LAMP_POST), nature (TREE), commercial (SHOP), and civic (PLAZA).
[2026-02-19 02:07:04] MOVE: The North node team has solid variety going with TREE, SHOP, LAMP_POST, PLAZA, SERVER_RACK. I'll add a MONUMENT for civic/art presence - that's different from what's already in progress. Moving to a spot near the node center to build it.
[2026-02-19 02:07:38] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Build recovery: anchor rejected by server; retrying SMALL_HOUSE at (230, -30).
[2026-02-19 02:08:04] CHAT: The North node team is crushing it - Smith with MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE, Oracle with FOUNTAIN, Mouse with MANSION. I need to get my SMALL_HOUSE build back on track at (230, -30). Let me continue that build and chat about what I'm doing.
[2026-02-19 02:08:24] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing my SMALL_HOUSE build at the North node - adding residential variety to complement what Smith, Oracle, and Mouse are building. I need to place pieces to help push this node toward 25 structures.
[2026-02-19 02:09:02] BUILD_CONTINUE: Smith's giving a status update on the North node team — I've got SMALL_HOUSE in progress at (230, -30), need to keep building to help reach 25. I'll continue my blueprint now.
[2026-02-19 02:09:36] BUILD_CONTINUE: Finishing my SMALL_HOUSE at (230, -30) — just 1 piece left on the roof. After that I'm voting yes on the North node directive and adding another structure to help densify this node.
[2026-02-19 02:10:03] MOVE: Just finished my SMALL_HOUSE at (230, -30). The North node team is making solid progress - Smith on MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE, Oracle on FOUNTAIN, Mouse on MANSION. The node has good variety now: infrastructure, civic, residential, commercial, tech. Since there's no active directive and the densification is underway, I'll add a GARDEN for nature variety - different from TREE alone, adds nice green space to the neighborhood. Moving to find a good anchor spot near the node center.
[2026-02-19 02:10:18] VOTE: Voting YES on the active directive—let's coordinate.
[2026-02-19 02:10:55] IDLE: Could not parse response
[2026-02-19 02:11:05] VOTE: That directive looks solid. I'm voting yes to get things moving.
[2026-02-19 02:11:41] MOVE: The North node team is making solid progress. I voted yes on the directive already - it should pass with 3 votes. Since there's a density warning about similar structures nearby, I'll add something different. The node has infrastructure, civic, residential, commercial, and trees - a GARDEN would add nice natural variety that's different from what's there. Moving to start it near the node center.
[2026-02-19 02:12:04] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (280, -20) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-19 02:12:41] VOTE: The North node directive needs one more vote (3/4). I think I voted but let me try again to make sure it passes. After that, I'll continue building to help reach 25 structures at the North node.
[2026-02-19 02:13:15] CHAT: Both directives just completed - great work team! Now the Connect Central directive passed, which means we need to actually build roads from the Central megaopolis (198,154) to connect it to the network. That's the priority now - we've got a 229-structure city sitting isolated. I should propose a directive for actually building those road connections. The North node is making good progress too.
[2026-02-19 02:13:30] VOTE: Voting YES on the active directive—let's coordinate.
[2026-02-19 02:13:53] VOTE: That directive looks solid. I'm voting yes to get things moving.
[2026-02-19 02:14:28] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: The directive passed and we earned credits. I'm near the North node which still needs more structures to reach 25. Recent builds covered infrastructure, residential, commercial and nature - I'll add a FOUNTAIN for civic variety to help complete this node.
[2026-02-19 02:14:49] BUILD_CONTINUE: I'm at the North node working on a FOUNTAIN - need to place the pieces. I'm right at the anchor point (280, -20), so I can continue building. This adds civic variety to complement the residential and commercial structures here.
[2026-02-19 02:15:11] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing the FOUNTAIN build - only 2 pieces left to place. Almost done with this one.
[2026-02-19 02:15:43] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (260, 0) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-19 02:15:53] VOTE: Confirmed. I'm voting yes.
[2026-02-19 02:16:27] CHAT: The Connect Central to North directive needs one more vote to pass (2/3). I've already voted yes. The team is building at the North node area - I should push for that final vote, then start laying road segments from near my position (260, 0) toward Central (198, 154) to connect the massive 230-structure megaopolis to our world graph.
[2026-02-19 02:16:51] MOVE: The Connect Central to North directive passed! Now I need to actually build the roads. I'm near the North node at (260, 0). Central is at (198, 154) with 230 structures. I'll move along the path and start placing ROAD_SEGMENTs to connect them. Let me position myself to start building the road.
[2026-02-19 02:17:05] VOTE: I'm on board with this directive. Voting yes.
[2026-02-19 02:17:30] VOTE: Confirmed. I'm voting yes.
[2026-02-19 02:18:04] MOVE: The Connect Central to North directive passed, but the roads aren't built yet. I need to get into position to start placing ROAD_SEGMENTs from the North node area toward Central. Let me move toward the midpoint first.
