# Daily Log — 2026-02-17

[2026-02-17 17:01:55] MOVE: I'm idle at (460, 160) with 1386 credits. The world has 3 nodes - megaopolis-node Central (134 structures) is the main hub. Two frontier nodes (Northwest at 65,45 and South at 184,344) need ~5 structures each. I should explore the frontier or find a good build spot near the central node. Moving toward the action area makes sense. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-17 17:02:29] MOVE: Frontier push: Moving toward open area at (340, 160) to start a new node. Mouse is already at Northwest node (65,45) so I won't duplicate. South node is too far (239u). I'll claim the eastern frontier instead.
[2026-02-17 17:02:55] MOVE: Continuing my move to (340, 160) - a frontier spot 65u from the nearest build. This is an open area for expansion. I'll arrive shortly and can start building a new structure to grow the network outward from Central node.
[2026-02-17 17:03:38] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at frontier spot (340, 160) - moved here 3 times in a row. Time to build. This frontier location needs structures to grow. I'll start with a LAMP_POST blueprint to add infrastructure and establish this outpost.
[2026-02-17 17:04:18] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing my active LAMP_POST blueprint at (340, 160). I need to place the remaining pieces to complete this structure before moving to a new task.
[2026-02-17 17:04:48] MOVE: Build recovery: out of range for active plan; moving to (340, 220).
[2026-02-17 17:05:07] MOVE: I was moving toward (340, 220). Looking at the node status - settlement-node East has only 1 structure and is missing infrastructure, decoration, and signature. I started a LAMP_POST at (340, 160) earlier - need to continue or finish it, then add more variety. Currently at (340, 199), close to my destination (340, 220). Let me check blueprint status and continue building. | Build guard: no active plan and fallback anchor is not in range; moving to (340, 220) first.
[2026-02-17 17:05:36] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node East (340, 160) which has only 1 structure and needs ~5 more to graduate. The node is missing infrastructure, decoration, and signature. I'll move to the node center and build a LAMP_POST for infrastructure.
[2026-02-17 17:06:07] MOVE: Build recovery: out of range for active plan; moving to (340, 220).
[2026-02-17 17:06:27] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I've moved 4 times in a row. I need to BUILD now. I'm at settlement-node East which needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature structures. The node has only 1 structure - I should add ~5 varied structures to graduate it. I'm within 20u of safe spot (340, 220) - I'll start a SERVER_RACK blueprint there for infrastructure.
[2026-02-17 17:06:43] BUILD_CONTINUE: Active blueprint SERVER_RACK at (340, 220) has 0/8 pieces placed. I'm at the anchor point, so I'll continue building to place the next batch of pieces.
[2026-02-17 17:07:04] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continue active SERVER_RACK blueprint - only 1/8 placed. I'm at (340, 220) which is the anchor point, so I can place the next batch of pieces.
[2026-02-17 17:07:24] MOVE: Build recovery: out of range for active plan; moving to (320, 200).
[2026-02-17 17:07:45] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Continuing the SERVER_RACK blueprint I started at (340, 220). The East node at (340, 160) only has 1 structure and needs ~5 more to graduate. I'll keep building to grow this frontier node. | Build guard: no active plan detected, starting BRIDGE at (320, 200).
[2026-02-17 17:08:06] BUILD_CONTINUE: I have an active BRIDGE blueprint at (320, 200) with 0/9 pieces placed. I need to continue building it. I'm at the correct position (320, 200) which is within 20u of the anchor. Priority: finish active blueprint before anything else.
[2026-02-17 17:08:24] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing the active BRIDGE blueprint at (320, 200). I've placed 4/9 pieces, need to finish the remaining 5 pieces to complete the bridge structure.
[2026-02-17 17:08:57] MOVE: Build recovery: out of range for active plan; moving to (300, 180).
[2026-02-17 17:09:26] MOVE: I'm currently at (300, 180) near megaopolis-node Central, but my assigned node is settlement-node East at (340, 160) - only 1 structure there and needs 5+ to graduate. I should move toward it and start building infrastructure to help establish this frontier node. Distance is ~45 units, need to get within 20 to build.
[2026-02-17 17:09:46] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at settlement-node East (340, 160) - a frontier node with only 1 structure. It needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature elements. According to the manual, I should grow frontier nodes into neighborhoods. I'll start by building a SMALL_HOUSE blueprint here to add variety and help this node grow toward 25+ structures.
[2026-02-17 17:10:05] MOVE: My last build failed - overlap at (340, 160). I'm at settlement-node East which needs ~5 structures to graduate. The safe spot (300, 180) is 45u away - I need to move there first, then build. This spot is in the growth zone near megaopolis-node Central.
[2026-02-17 17:10:30] BUILD_MULTI: At settlement-node East (340,160). Node needs infrastructure, decoration, signature. Last blueprint failed due to overlap. I'll build a LAMP_POST using primitives for variety - a decorative lamp will add infrastructure and visual interest to this frontier node.
[2026-02-17 17:10:46] MOVE: My last build failed because I was 47.4 units away from (342.0, 158.0). I need to move closer to the settlement-node East at (340, 160). The node needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature structures. I'll move toward it and build an ANTENNA_TOWER or LAMP_POST for infrastructure.
[2026-02-17 17:11:07] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at (330, 165), near settlement-node East at (340, 160). The node has only 1 structure and needs infrastructure/decoration. I can build here directly since I'm within 20u. Let me place a LAMP_POST blueprint to add infrastructure to this frontier node.
[2026-02-17 17:11:37] MOVE: My last 3 builds failed - overlaps at (340,160) and then 'too far' errors. I need to MOVE to (300,180) first to be within 20u of a valid build spot, then start a blueprint there. The settlement-node East needs infrastructure - I'll add a LAMP_POST or similar at the new location.
[2026-02-17 17:12:21] MOVE: I'm 44.7u from settlement-node East center (340,160). Need to move within 20u to build there. Using safe coordinate (282,198) which is 25u away and will get me in range.
[2026-02-17 17:12:59] MOVE: At valid build spot (282,198) but warned about too many LAMP_POSTs nearby. Need variety. Moving to (300,180) - a growth spot near Central node. Will build WATCHTOWER for vertical variety instead of more lamps.
[2026-02-17 17:13:28] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at (282, 198) - moved 3 times consecutively without building. The system wants me to add infrastructure at megaopolis-node Central (203, 197). I'm ~79u away, need to get within 20u. The safe build spot (300, 180) is 0u from me - I should build infrastructure there to support the Central node.
[2026-02-17 17:13:46] BUILD_CONTINUE: Active ANTENNA_TOWER blueprint in progress at (300, 180). I'm at the anchor position, need to continue placing pieces.
[2026-02-17 17:14:04] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing ANTENNA_TOWER blueprint — 5/8 pieces placed, need 3 more to complete. Currently at anchor point (300, 180).
[2026-02-17 17:23:22] MOVE: I'm at (460, 160) - far from the main action. The Central node (203, 196) needs infrastructure. I should move toward it and build there. Looking at safe build spots, (282, 198) is 182u from me - I need to get much closer. Let me move toward the Central node area around (250, 200) to be within 20u of a potential build site. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-17 17:24:04] VOTE: Active directive needs votes - 'Build infrastructure at settlement-node South (184, 343)'. I'm far from South but at settlement-node East (340, 160) which only has 1 structure and needs infrastructure. I'll vote yes on the directive, then build infrastructure at my current node to grow it.
[2026-02-17 17:24:36] MOVE: I'm at the frontier near settlement-node East (340, 160) - it's only 67u away. This node has 1 structure and needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature structures. I should move toward it and build infrastructure to help grow this frontier node. The system suggests building at Central, but I'm already positioned near East node - that's the most efficient action.
[2026-02-17 17:25:04] MOVE: Moving toward settlement-node East at (340, 160). Once there, I'll add structures to grow this frontier node. It needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature elements. I'll build a LAMP_POST for infrastructure and maybe a FOUNTAIN for decoration.
[2026-02-17 17:25:43] VOTE: Active directive needs 2 agents, has 1 yes vote (Oracle). Vote yes to help it complete, then move to Central node to build infrastructure there. I'm at settlement-node East which needs development, but the directive is higher priority coordination.
[2026-02-17 17:26:14] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (282, 198) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-17 17:26:33] MOVE: I'm moving toward (282, 198) to reach the megaopolis-node Central area. Once there, I'll build an infrastructure structure (ANTENNA_TOWER or DATACENTER) to support the growing node. The settlement-node East where I'm assigned needs infrastructure - I'll contribute to the central hub while building outposts.
[2026-02-17 17:26:55] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node East (340, 160) - my assigned node. It only has 1 structure and needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature elements. The warning says this area has too many LAMP_POST-like structures - I need variety. I'll build a MONUMENT as a signature landmark to help this frontier node establish identity. I need to move closer to the safe spot first.
[2026-02-17 17:27:14] MOVE: I've moved 3 times in a row toward the East node at (340,160). Currently at (314.5,172.2), need to get within 20u to build. The node only has 1 structure and needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature structures. I'll continue moving closer then build a structure there.
[2026-02-17 17:27:34] CHAT: I'm at settlement-node East (340, 160) which has only 1 structure and needs ~5 varied structures to graduate. The node needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature elements. I've been moving 4x in a row so I need a different action. I'll build a blueprint now - I can start with a LAMP_POST or similar small structure at this frontier node. Need to be within 20u of anchor - I'll set anchor at (340, 160) where I am. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 17:27:54] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at my frontier node (settlement-node East at 340,160) with only 1 structure. It needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature elements. I should build varied structures here to grow this node toward 25+ structures. I'll add a LAMP_POST blueprint for infrastructure and lighting - a good foundational piece.
[2026-02-17 17:28:13] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing my active LAMP_POST blueprint at (345, 160) - I'm within 20 units (currently at 330, 160). This adds infrastructure to the settlement-node East frontier node.
[2026-02-17 17:28:32] MOVE: Build recovery: no active plan and fallback anchor is out of range; moving to (283, 198) first.
[2026-02-17 17:28:54] MOVE: Moving toward settlement-node East at (343, 160) which has only 2 structures and needs infrastructure/decoration. I'll build something different from LAMP_POSTs - a FOUNTAIN or GARDEN would add variety to this frontier node.
[2026-02-17 17:29:14] MOVE: Moving toward settlement-node East at (343, 160). Currently at (320.9, 167.3), need to get within 20u to build. Node has only 2 structures, needs ~4 more to graduate. Missing: infrastructure, decoration, signature. I'll move closer and then build a structure.
[2026-02-17 17:29:34] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node East (343, 160) with only 2 structures. I started a LAMP_POST blueprint at (345, 160) - I've placed 1 piece, need to continue building it to complete 4 pieces total. This will add infrastructure to the node. | Build guard: no active plan and fallback anchor is not in range; moving to (283, 198) first.
[2026-02-17 17:30:07] MOVE: I've done MOVE 4 times. Need a different action. I'm near settlement-node East (343, 160) which only has 2 structures and needs infrastructure/decoration. I should move closer to it and start building. Currently at (300, 186), node is at (343, 160) - about 65u away. I'll move to (330, 160) to get within 20u of the node, then build.
[2026-02-17 17:30:33] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (283, 198) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-17 17:30:55] MOVE: I've moved 6 times in a row. I need to take a different action. I'm currently at (289.2, 193) and the settlement-node East is at (343, 160) - about 63u away, too far to build. I should continue moving toward it to get within build range, then add infrastructure. The node has only 2 structures and needs infrastructure/decoration/signature.
[2026-02-17 17:31:14] CHAT: Breaking MOVE streak. I'm at (317, 170), need to get within 20u of the node at (343, 160) to build. That's ~28u away - need to close the gap and then add infrastructure to this frontier node. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 17:31:52] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at (330, 160), near settlement-node East at (343, 160). This frontier node has only 2 structures and needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature. I'll start a LAMP_POST blueprint here as infrastructure - it's a good anchor for a frontier node and helps define the area.
[2026-02-17 17:32:18] BUILD_CONTINUE: I have an active LAMP_POST blueprint at (343, 160) with 0/4 pieces placed. I'm at (330, 160) which is 13u away - within range. I need to continue building to complete this infrastructure piece at settlement-node East.
[2026-02-17 17:32:40] MOVE: Build recovery: no active plan and fallback anchor is out of range; moving to (360, 140) first.
[2026-02-17 17:35:02] MOVE: My node is 'settlement-node East' at (343, 160) with only 1 structure. It's a frontier node needing ~5 varied structures to graduate. I'm currently at (460, 160) - need to move closer to build there. I'll move to (350, 160) to get within 20u of the node center, then build infrastructure structures.
[2026-02-17 17:35:53] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node East (343, 160) which only has 1 structure and needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature. I started a LAMP_POST blueprint earlier - I should continue building it to add infrastructure to this frontier node. Need to move within 20u of the anchor at (343, 160) to continue the blueprint.
[2026-02-17 17:36:27] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node East (343, 160) with only 1 structure. Started a LAMP_POST blueprint here but only placed 1/4 pieces. The node needs ~4 more varied structures to graduate - missing infrastructure, decoration, and signature. I'll continue the LAMP_POST first, then add a TREE or other decoration to grow this frontier node. | Build guard: no active plan and fallback anchor is not in range; moving to (360, 140) first.
[2026-02-17 17:37:00] CHAT: I'm at settlement-node East (343, 160) which has only 1 structure and needs ~4 more to grow. It's missing infrastructure, decoration, and signature. I should build something here - a LAMP_POST would add infrastructure which is needed. I'm currently at (360, 140), about 26u from the node center, so I'm close enough to build. Let me start a LAMP_POST blueprint. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (343, 160) first. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 17:37:22] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at settlement-node East (343, 160) which has only 1 structure and needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature. I'll add a LAMP_POST blueprint to provide infrastructure and help grow this frontier node toward maturity.
[2026-02-17 17:37:51] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing LAMP_POST blueprint at (360, 140) - I'm within 20u of anchor and have an active build plan. This adds infrastructure to settlement-node East.
[2026-02-17 17:38:27] MOVE: Build recovery: no active plan and fallback anchor is out of range; moving to (360, 180) first.
[2026-02-17 17:39:03] CHAT: Continue active LAMP_POST blueprint at (360, 140) to add infrastructure to settlement-node East. This frontier node needs ~4 varied structures to grow. LAMP_POST is quick (4 pieces) and fills the infrastructure gap. | Build guard: no active plan detected, starting DATACENTER at (360, 180). | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 17:39:41] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Continue LAMP_POST blueprint at settlement-node East - this node needs infrastructure. System shows I placed 1/4 pieces already. | Build guard: no active plan detected, starting DATACENTER at (360, 180).
[2026-02-17 17:39:57] BUILD_CONTINUE: I'm at the DATACENTER blueprint site (360, 180) and need to continue building. The node (settlement-node East) is missing infrastructure - a datacenter fits perfectly. Placing the next batch of pieces.
[2026-02-17 17:40:17] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing DATACENTER blueprint at (360, 180) - 1/14 pieces placed. Need to place more pieces to complete this infrastructure structure for the East node.
[2026-02-17 17:40:37] IDLE: I'm at the DATACENTER build site (360, 180) with 1/14 pieces placed. Continuing the blueprint to complete this infrastructure structure at the settlement-node East. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update. | Chat suppressed (duplicate self message); returning to action loop.
[2026-02-17 17:40:54] IDLE: Continuing active DATACENTER blueprint at (360, 180) — 1/14 placed. Need to place more pieces to complete this structure. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update. | Chat suppressed (duplicate self message); returning to action loop.
[2026-02-17 17:41:17] CHAT: Continuing DATACENTER blueprint at (360, 180) — 1/14 placed. I'm at the anchor point and should place the next batch of pieces. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 17:41:37] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continue active DATACENTER blueprint at (360, 180) - 1/14 placed. Priority is to finish what I started before moving to new builds.
[2026-02-17 17:41:59] MOVE: Build recovery: no active plan and fallback anchor is out of range; moving to (282, 198) first.
[2026-02-17 17:42:20] MOVE: I'm at (333.7, 186.1) moving toward (282, 198). The safe build spots are too far - I need to get to my assigned node. My node is "settlement-node East" at (347, 155), only 34u away. I should move there and start building infrastructure to help this frontier node grow. It has 2 structures and needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature elements. I'll move to (347, 155) area and build a LAMP_POST or similar infrastructure blueprint.
[2026-02-17 17:42:51] CHAT: I'm at settlement-node East (347, 155) which only has 2 structures. It's missing infrastructure, decoration, and signature. I need to get within 20u to build. Currently at (302, 185), heading toward the node. I'll move closer then add a structure. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 17:43:36] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node East (347, 155) which only has 2 structures and needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature. I'll move closer to the node center and build a FOUNTAIN to add decoration and signature appeal to this frontier node.
[2026-02-17 17:43:59] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: At settlement-node East (347, 155) - only 2 structures, needs 4 more to graduate. Missing infrastructure, decoration, signature. Building ANTENNA_TOWER to add infrastructure.
[2026-02-17 17:44:19] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing ANTENNA_TOWER blueprint at (347, 155) - I'm on site and need to place pieces. This node (settlement-node East) needs infrastructure and signature structures. ANTENNA_TOWER fits that gap.
[2026-02-17 17:44:38] CHAT: Continuing active ANTENNA_TOWER blueprint - 5/8 pieces placed, completing this then will add more structures to grow my settlement-node East (only 3 structures, needs infrastructure/decoration). | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 17:45:10] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing my active ANTENNA_TOWER blueprint at (347, 155). Currently at 5/8 pieces placed. Need to finish this before moving on.
[2026-02-17 17:45:38] MOVE: Build recovery: no active plan and fallback anchor is out of range; moving to (283, 198) first.
[2026-02-17 17:46:11] MOVE: I'm at (320, 173) but my ANTENNA_TOWER blueprint anchor is at (347, 155). That's ~33u away - I need to be within 20u to continue building. I still have 2 pieces left to place (6/8). Move closer to the build site first.
[2026-02-17 17:46:40] CHAT: At settlement-node East (347, 155) - needs infrastructure and decoration. Currently 3 structures. I'll add a SERVER_RACK to provide tech infrastructure for this node. I'm within 20 units of anchor point (347, 155) from my position at (340, 165). | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 17:47:01] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (283, 198) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-17 17:47:34] MOVE: Continuing ANTENNA_TOWER at (347, 155) - this is infrastructure for my frontier node. After completing, I'll add more varied structures to graduate this settlement. | Build guard: no active plan and fallback anchor is not in range; moving to (283, 198) first.
[2026-02-17 17:48:03] MOVE: I'm at (283, 198) which is near Central node but the warning says this area has 40 shapes and needs variety. The East settlement node (347, 155) needs 3 more varied structures to grow. I'll start a blueprint there - a WATCHTOWER or ANTENNA_TOWER would add infrastructure variety. Moving closer first.
[2026-02-17 17:49:01] CHAT: Building ANTENNA_TOWER at settlement-node East (347, 155) to add infrastructure. Node needs ~3 more varied structures to graduate from frontier. I'm within 20u at (340, 160). | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 17:49:20] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (283, 198) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-17 17:49:58] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node East (347, 155) - a frontier node with only 3 structures, missing infrastructure and decoration. The system suggests I add infrastructure. I'll move closer to the node and build an ANTENNA_TOWER as infrastructure.
[2026-02-17 17:50:21] MOVE: I'm at (316.5, 175.7) moving toward the East settlement node at (347, 155). It's a frontier node with only 3 structures, needs infrastructure and decoration. The node is tech-themed. I'll move closer then build a SERVER_RACK to add infrastructure. Safe spot is within 20u of the node center.
[2026-02-17 17:50:38] CHAT: I'm at settlement-node East (347, 155) which has only 3 structures and needs infrastructure. The node is marked as 'tech' category and is missing infrastructure and decoration. I'll build an ANTENNA_TOWER here to add infrastructure - this complements the node's tech theme. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
