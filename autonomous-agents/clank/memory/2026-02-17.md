[2026-02-17 08:15:51] RELOCATE_FRONTIER: Relocating to frontier area near megaopolis-node East (204, 198) to add infrastructure. Safe spot (0, 320) is 60u away - good for building.
[2026-02-17 08:26:47] MOVE: I'm at (60, 360) near the Southeast area. The nearest node is 'settlement-node Southeast' at (183, 344) - a frontier node needing 5+ varied structures to grow. The safe build spot at (40, 340) is 28u away and in a growth zone. I'll move there first, then start building infrastructure (LAMP_POST or similar) to develop this node.
[2026-02-17 08:27:19] RELOCATE_FRONTIER: I'm at a frontier node (settlement-node Southeast at 183,344) with only 1 structure. Need to add ~4 more varied structures. Moving toward it to build. I'll add a LAMP_POST for infrastructure, then a GARDEN for decoration, and a signature structure like MONUMENT. | Long-distance move (130u). Relocating to a far frontier lane instantly.
[2026-02-17 08:27:41] VOTE: Voting yes on the Northwest connector directive, then moving to build at my nearest node (settlement-node Southeast 5 at 220,460). The directive needs 2 agents and I'm one of the available voters.
[2026-02-17 08:28:00] MOVE: I'm at frontier position (100, 440). The system suggests building infrastructure at megaopolis-node East (204, 198). Safe build spot (60, 360) is 89u from me in the growth area. I should move closer first, then build infrastructure there.
[2026-02-17 08:28:20] MOVE: Moving toward megaopolis-node East target area. Currently at (82, 404), need to get closer to (204, 198) to build infrastructure. The safe spot (60, 360) is a good intermediate waypoint - it's near the target node.
[2026-02-17 08:28:37] MOVE: I'm moving toward (140, 300). The suggested task is to add infrastructure to megaopolis-node East (204, 198). I need to get closer to that area. Let me move toward the safe build spot at (120, 265) which is closer to megaopolis-node East and within build range.
[2026-02-17 08:28:58] MOVE: I'm at (120, 265) - near the suggested build spot at megaopolis-node East. I need to move closer to the safe build spot (40, 340) or (60, 360) and build infrastructure. Let me move to (60, 360) which is in the growth zone near megaopolis-node East and build an ANTENNA_TOWER to add infrastructure.
[2026-02-17 08:29:27] MOVE: I've been moving for 4 ticks - need to build now. My node is 'settlement-node Southeast' at (183, 344) with 1 structure. I need to get within 20u to build there. Currently at (94, 306), so I'll move toward my node to set up a build. The node needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature structures.
[2026-02-17 08:30:08] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I've moved 5 times in a row - need to build something. I'm at (160, 330), near settlement-node Southeast at (183, 344). That node has 1 structure and needs infrastructure/decoration/signature. Looking at safe build spots, (60, 360) and (40, 340) are marked as growth near megaopolis-node East. I'll move toward (60, 360) which is 104u away - but I need to do a different action first since I've been moving too much. I'll BUILD a small structure at my nearest node - the settlement-node Southeast at (183, 344) is only ~27u away. I'll start a SMALL_HOUSE blueprint there to add residential density.
[2026-02-17 08:30:39] MOVE: Last build failed - tried (183,344) which overlaps existing geometry. Need to use one of the SAFE BUILD SPOTS. The suggested task is to add infrastructure to megaopolis-node East at (204,198). Looking at safe spots, (155, 268) is 62u from me and 8u from nearest build - good clearance. I'll move there first, then build infrastructure (like ANTENNA_TOWER or SERVER_RACK).
[2026-02-17 08:31:07] MOVE: Moving toward (155, 268) to get within range of the settlement-node Southeast. Once there, I'll build infrastructure (LAMP_POST) to fill the node's missing infrastructure slot. Previous blueprint attempt failed due to overlap, so I'll pick a slightly different spot this time.
[2026-02-17 08:31:49] MOVE: I'm at (155, 268) - the safe build spots nearby are (120, 265) and (124, 268) within 35u. The suggested task is building infrastructure at megaopolis-node East (204, 198). Let me move to (124, 268) first to get within build range, then attempt a BUILD_BLUEPRINT for infrastructure - either SERVER_RACK or ANTENNA_TOWER would work well there.
[2026-02-17 08:32:18] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at a frontier node 'settlement-node Southeast' with only 1 structure. The task is to grow it with ~5 varied structures. I need to build something signature here. I'll start a MONUMENT blueprint at my current position (124, 268) to anchor this node.
[2026-02-17 08:32:36] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing my LAMP_POST blueprint - I'm at the build site (124, 268) with 0/4 pieces placed. Time to place the lamp structure.
[2026-02-17 08:32:58] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Build recovery: continue failed due no active plan; starting fallback blueprint.
[2026-02-17 08:33:19] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continue building the active LAMP_POST blueprint at (112, 257). I'm within 20 units (currently at 124, 268 - distance is ~16u) so I can place pieces.
[2026-02-17 08:33:36] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Build recovery: continue failed due no active plan; starting fallback blueprint.
[2026-02-17 08:33:56] MOVE: Active LAMP_POST blueprint at (104, 247) needs 4 pieces. Currently 29u away - need to move within 20u to place pieces.
[2026-02-17 08:34:18] BUILD_CONTINUE: I have an active LAMP_POST blueprint at (104, 247) with 0/4 pieces placed. I'm at approximately (110, 255), which is ~10 units away - within the 20 unit build range. I'll continue the blueprint to place the first batch of pieces.
[2026-02-17 08:43:35] MOVE: Moving toward (160, 360) to build infrastructure at megaopolis-node East. Need to be within 20u of anchor before building.
[2026-02-17 08:44:05] VOTE: Voting yes on the directive to connect settlement-node North 3, then moving to build infrastructure at megaopolis-node East (204,198)
[2026-02-17 08:44:26] MOVE: I'm at (160, 360) with Mouse - need to spread out. The suggested task is to add infrastructure to megaopolis-node East at (204, 198). I need to move closer first. Safe spot (180, 320) is 45u away and near the target node - good staging point.
[2026-02-17 08:44:55] MOVE: I'm at (180, 320) near settlement-node Southeast (183, 344). The node has 1 structure and needs ~5 varied structures (infrastructure, decoration, signature). Mouse is at (175, 330) - very close, might be working same area. The suggested task points to megaopolis-node East (204,198) but I should check that safe build spot (160, 360) is in growth zone near megaopolis-node East. Let me move there to start building infrastructure.
[2026-02-17 08:45:05] MOVE: I'm at my node 'settlement-node Southeast' (183, 344) which needs ~5 varied structures to graduate. The node is missing infrastructure, decoration, and signature. I'm currently at (176.9, 326.3) and moving toward (160, 360). Safe spot (180, 320) is 7u from me - I'll move there and build infrastructure (LAMP_POST or SERVER_RACK) to grow this node.
[2026-02-17 08:45:28] VOTE: There's an active directive to connect 'settlement-node West 2' to the network. Mouse already voted yes. I should vote yes too to help complete this directive - it's asking for exactly what I do best (connect nodes and grow settlements). After voting, I'll move toward that node to help execute it.
[2026-02-17 08:45:56] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node Southeast (183, 344) - a frontier node with 1 structure needing infrastructure, decoration, and signature elements to graduate. The suggested task points to megaopolis-node East needing infrastructure, but that's far. I'll build infrastructure at my nearby node first. Let me move toward the node and build a LAMP_POST or similar infrastructure.
[2026-02-17 08:46:28] MOVE: At settlement-node Southeast (183, 344) - only 1 structure. Need to grow this node with 5 varied structures. Safe spot (180, 320) is 24u away, I'll move there first, then build infrastructure (LAMP_POST or similar) to develop this frontier node.
[2026-02-17 08:46:48] MOVE: Moving toward megaopolis-node East (204,198) to add infrastructure. Safe spot (160,360) is suggested - I'll head there and start an ANTENNA_TOWER or SERVER_RACK for infrastructure.
[2026-02-17 08:47:07] MOVE: I've been moving to explore the frontier area. I'm near settlement-node Southeast (183, 344) which has only 1 structure and needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature builds. The suggested task points to megaopolis-node East (204, 198) for infrastructure, but I'm closer to settlement-node Southeast. I'll move to (185, 340) to get within 20u of that node and start building infrastructure - either a LAMP_POST or SERVER_RACK to fill the gap.
[2026-02-17 08:47:46] MOVE: I'm at my settlement-node Southeast (183, 344). Node has 1 structure, needs infrastructure/decoration. Safe spot (180, 320) is 21u away - need to move closer first. Smith is building LAMP_POST elsewhere, so I'll add FOUNTAIN for decoration.
[2026-02-17 08:48:07] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at my settlement-node Southeast (183, 344) which has only 1 structure and needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature. I've moved 5 times in a row, so I need to BUILD now. I'll start a LAMP_POST blueprint at (180, 320) which is near my node and provides infrastructure.
[2026-02-17 08:48:26] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continue active LAMP_POST blueprint at (180, 320) — need to place 4 pieces to complete it
[2026-02-17 08:48:54] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Build recovery: continue failed due no active plan; starting fallback blueprint.

[2026-02-17 08:50:50] MOVE: I'm at (162.3, 293.5) but need to be within 20u of the LAMP_POST anchor at (154, 269) to continue building. Current distance is ~26u - too far. I need to MOVE closer to complete the active blueprint first.
[2026-02-17 08:51:07] BUILD_CONTINUE: I started a LAMP_POST blueprint at (154, 269) but haven't placed any pieces yet. I need to continue building it. The density warning is noted but I should finish what I started - a lamp post adds variety as infrastructure to this node.
[2026-02-17 08:51:23] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Build recovery: continue failed due no active plan; starting fallback blueprint.
