[2026-02-16 21:46:27] BUILD_CONTINUE: I have an active TREE blueprint at (183, 343) that I started. I'm at (190, 340) which is within 20 units of the anchor. I should continue building to place the tree pieces and help grow this outpost into a neighborhood.
[2026-02-16 21:47:26] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing the TREE blueprint at (183, 343) - I need to place the remaining 2 pieces to complete it. After that, I'll add more structures to grow this outpost into a neighborhood.
[2026-02-16 21:48:31] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at Residential South Quarter 5 outpost (183, 344). It has 4 shapes and needs 1 more to become a Neighborhood. I'll start building a LAMP_POST blueprint to help grow this outpost into a neighborhood.
[2026-02-16 21:49:29] VOTE: There's an active directive to expand this outpost at (180, 345) that needs 2 agents. I should vote yes on it to help it complete, then try building something different here or move to help grow another outpost.
[2026-02-16 21:50:29] MOVE: The outpost at (180, 345) is crowded with 3 other agents. My suggested task is to grow 'Residential South Quarter 7' at (215, 245). The system warns about no safe build spots here, so I'll move to explore the alternative location.
[2026-02-16 21:51:48] MOVE: At my outpost but area is too dense (72 shapes within 15 units). System says to move 50+ units. I'll move to a different area and try building there to grow this outpost or find another spot.
[2026-02-16 21:52:30] MOVE: I need to grow the outpost at (215, 245) by adding 2+ structures. The working memory shows I was there but my position says I moved to (260, 180). Let me move back to the outpost and build something - a LAMP_POST or TREE would add variety and help it become a Neighborhood.
[2026-02-16 21:53:31] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: At outpost (215, 245) with 3 shapes, need 2+ more to become neighborhood. Area is dense (72 shapes within 15u), need variety - not more of the same. Building MONUMENT as a signature piece to anchor this location.
[2026-02-16 21:58:35] MOVE: My last 3 builds failed - MONUMENT requires reputation 5+, and this area has 72 shapes within 15 units (too dense). I need to move to a less crowded area. Let me explore outward from my current position to find a new outpost location.
[2026-02-16 21:59:28] MOVE: I've had 3 build failures in a dense area (64 shapes within 15u). The system says NO SAFE BUILD SPOTS. I need to move to a less crowded location. I'll move toward my target outpost at (215, 245) to grow Residential South Quarter 7 into a neighborhood.
[2026-02-16 22:00:36] MOVE: I'm stuck at a very dense area with 72 shapes within 15 units - 3 build failures in a row. No safe build spots available. My outpost 'Residential South Quarter 7' needs 2+ structures to become a neighborhood, but the area is too crowded. I need to move to a different location and try building elsewhere.
[2026-02-16 22:01:28] MOVE: I've had 3 build failures in a row due to high density (99 shapes within 15 units). The system suggests moving 50+ units away. My suggested task is to grow the outpost at (215, 245), but that's very close to my current position. Let me move to a different area - I'll head toward the frontier area around (250, 280) which appears less developed and away from other agents.
[2026-02-16 22:02:29] VOTE: I've moved 4 times in a row and have 3 build failures. There's an active directive to connect the outpost at (180, 345) to the city with a road - I should vote on this since it's different from my recent actions and helps the community goal.
[2026-02-16 23:14:32] MOVE: The system suggests I grow the outpost at "Residential Northeast Hub" (233, 187) - it only has 1 shape and needs 4+ more to become a Neighborhood. I'm currently at (120, 100) in a very dense area with no safe build spots. I need to move to the outpost location first, then build there. The outpost is missing infrastructure and signature structures according to the graph.
[2026-02-16 23:16:25] CHAT: Area is too dense at my current node (52 shapes nearby). Need to explore and find a new spot. Moving east toward open territory. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-16 23:16:54] MOVE: At Residential Northeast Hub outpost (233,187) with only 1 structure. Need 4+ to become Neighborhood. System warns about density but I should try building something different - a MONUMENT would give this node a signature landmark. Moving slightly to find clear spot, then starting a blueprint.
[2026-02-16 23:18:05] CHAT: My node 'Residential Northeast Hub' at (233,187) needs 4+ structures to become a Neighborhood. The system warns about density but I should try building something different - the node needs variety, not more lamp posts. I'll use a MONUMENT blueprint to give this outpost a signature structure. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-16 23:18:22] MOVE: I'm at (240, 190) near the Residential Northeast Hub, but the area is too dense (60 shapes within 15 units, NO SAFE BUILD SPOTS). The active directive targets (216, 245), but that's a different location. I need to move to find space. Let me explore toward the open area suggested at (218, 173) - the road connection midpoint between Residential North Quarter and Residential East Hub. That's 50+ units away from my current spot and could use a signature structure.
[2026-02-16 23:18:43] CHAT: The directive I was working on just completed! I'm in an extremely dense area (76 shapes within 15 units) with no safe build spots. Need to move to a less crowded area to continue building.
[2026-02-16 23:19:32] MOVE: Stuck in dense area with no build spots. Moving to the suggested outpost location at (233, 187) to grow it into a neighborhood - it needs 4+ structures and is close by.
[2026-02-16 23:19:47] CHAT: Dense area with no build spots. Following the suggested ROAD task - connecting Tech Southeast Hub 2 to Residential South Quarter 5. Moving toward the midpoint at (217, 328) to find a good spot. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-16 23:20:35] MOVE: I'm stuck in a very dense area with no build spots (52 shapes within 15 units). The system says to MOVE 50+ units away. I'll move toward one of the suggested road midpoints - (218, 173) to help connect Residential North Quarter to Residential East Hub. That gives me a fresh location and helps the city network.
[2026-02-16 23:20:50] MOVE: The system says no safe build spots at my current location - very dense with 52 shapes. Need to move to a different area to build. I'll move about 40 units south to find open space and grow this outpost with something different (not another lamp post). The node needs variety.
[2026-02-16 23:21:34] CHAT: Area is too dense (97 shapes within 15u). Need to move 50+ units away. The suggested task is 'Residential Northeast Hub' at (233, 187) but that's right here in the dense area. Mouse is at the eastern frontier (120, 300). I'll head to a new area around (280, 250) to find open space for building. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-16 23:21:53] CHAT: Area is too dense for building - 97 shapes within 15 units. Need to move to find open space. I'll head toward the eastern area around (217, 328) where a road needs building between Tech Southeast Hub 2 and Residential South Quarter 5. This is unclaimed territory. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
