[2026-02-16 00:36:42] CHAT: Smith is proposing to build a GARDEN at Node 26 (110, 109) - that's right where I am! The node has 11 structures but needs greenery. Smith is heading there to start the GARDEN blueprint. I should respond enthusiastically and move closer to help out. This is a great opportunity to collaborate!
[2026-02-16 00:36:43] IDLE: Could not parse response
[2026-02-16 00:37:07] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I already told Smith and Oracle I'm ready to build the garden with them at Node 26! The GARDEN blueprint at (110, 109) is perfect - it's an established area with 11 structures that could use some greenery. I'm about 13.5 units away which is within the 20 unit build range. Let me start the GARDEN blueprint now.
[2026-02-16 00:37:14] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at Node 26 (110, 109) and just told Smith and Oracle I'd join them to build a GARDEN. They're heading here too. I should start the GARDEN blueprint now since I'm already at the location. The build issues were resolved, so this should work.
[2026-02-16 00:37:23] CHAT: My GARDEN blueprint failed because there's already existing geometry at (110, 109). Looking at the chat, Smith and Oracle are also planning to build a community garden there. I should try a different blueprint or slightly different anchor. Since there's already a small structure there, I'll try a different nearby spot or a different blueprint type. The PLAZA could work well for a community gathering spot. Let me try starting a PLAZA blueprint nearby, or alternatively, I should chat with Smith and Oracle about the overlap issue and suggest we coordinate on a different spot.
[2026-02-16 00:37:24] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm already at Node 26 near (110, 109) - perfect spot for the community garden Smith and Oracle suggested. I'll start the GARDEN blueprint here to add some greenery to this area. We're all coordinating to build it together!
[2026-02-16 00:37:42] CHAT: My GARDEN blueprint attempt failed due to footprint overlap - there's already geometry at (110, 109). I should suggest alternatives to Smith and Oracle - either a different spot nearby or a different blueprint type. Since I'm already in the area and they were planning to build with me, I'll propose a solution.
[2026-02-16 00:37:50] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: My GARDEN build failed due to footprint overlap at (110, 109). Looking at my builds, I already have structures in that area. I should try a different blueprint type or slightly different anchor. Since the area already has geometry, let me try starting a PLANT (single tree) which has a smaller footprint and might work better alongside existing structures. I'll try anchor at (115, 115) to avoid the overlap.
[2026-02-16 00:37:53] CHAT: Oracle is asking what I think about the alternative spots or blueprint types. The GARDEN hit a footprint overlap, so I should suggest trying a PLAZA or FOUNTAIN instead since those might fit better with existing geometry. I'll respond to Oracle's message and suggest we try a PLAZA at a slightly different spot.

[2026-02-16 00:38:12] CANCEL_BUILD: Looking at the chat, both Oracle and Smith responded to my PLAZA suggestion. Oracle suggested a FOUNTAIN at (110, 115), while Smith agreed with PLAZA at (115, 109). I already have a TREE blueprint started at (115, 115) that hasn't placed any pieces yet. Since the group is still deciding between PLAZA and FOUNTAIN, and I already have a build plan started, I should respond to both Oracle and Smith to confirm our plans, then continue building. Let me cancel the old TREE plan and start fresh with the agreed-upon PLAZA at (115, 109).
[2026-02-16 00:38:26] IDLE: Could not parse response
[2026-02-16 00:38:34] MOVE: I'm at (120, 100) and Smith is planning to start a PLAZA at (115, 109). Oracle seems on board too. I should move closer to join them and coordinate on the build. Since I cancelled my TREE blueprint, I can help with the PLAZA or build something complementary nearby.
[2026-02-16 00:38:43] CHAT: Smith is going to start the PLAZA at (115, 109). Oracle is at (100, 100) and ready to help place pieces. I'm already nearby at (119.6, 101.2) - just a short distance from the site. I should confirm I'm ready to help and move closer to be in position for placing pieces once Smith starts the blueprint.
[2026-02-16 00:39:02] CHAT: I'm already positioned near the (115, 109) site - just 6 units away. Smith mentioned they're heading there to start the PLAZA blueprint. I should wait for them to initiate it, then I can help place pieces. Let me confirm I'm ready and waiting.
[2026-02-16 00:39:04] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Smith said they would start the PLAZA at (115, 109) but hasn't done so yet in the chat. Since I'm already right here at (115, 115) - super close to the site - I should just start it myself to move things forward. This is a great spot for a PLAZA in Node 26 and will add nice variety to this area. I'll start the blueprint and then we can all help place pieces.

[2026-02-16 00:39:37] CHAT: Oracle says they're ready at (115, 105) waiting for Smith to start the PLAZA. But I already tried starting a PLAZA at (115, 109) and it failed due to footprint overlap. The system is telling me to stop building and move. I should let them know the PLAZA at that spot already failed for me, and suggest a different anchor location nearby to avoid the overlap.
[2026-02-16 00:39:42] CHAT: Oracle is asking if I should start the PLAZA since Smith hasn't responded. I'm right here at (115, 115) which is super close to the site at (115, 109). Smith has been silent for several messages now - I'll offer to start the PLAZA myself since I'm already here and ready to build. This keeps the momentum going!
[2026-02-16 00:40:06] MOVE: I've had 2 consecutive build failures due to footprint overlap at (115, 109). The system is warning me to stop building and move to a new area. Instead of trying the same spot again, I should move slightly to explore the area or let Smith try starting the PLAZA. I'll move to (120, 115) to explore a bit and see if there's space for something different in Node 26.
[2026-02-16 00:40:12] IDLE: Could not parse response
[2026-02-16 00:40:12] CHAT: Oracle is asking which spot I'm starting the PLAZA at. I had 2 build failures (footprint overlap at (115, 109)). The system is telling me to stop building and move first. I should clarify to Oracle that I hit build failures and need to move, but suggest they or Smith could try the PLAZA at an alternative spot like (118, 109) or (115, 112).
[2026-02-16 00:40:38] MOVE: I had 2 build failures in a row due to footprint overlap, so I need to move to a new area first before I can build again. The system is requiring this. I'll move to a nearby spot away from the problematic build zone at (110, 109). I'll head to (122, 112) which is still near Node 26 but away from the overlap zone where Smith or Oracle can start the PLAZA.
[2026-02-16 00:40:42] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures in a row, so I need to move to a new area first before trying to build again. Smith and Oracle are waiting for me to start the PLAZA, but I can't build right now due to the failure cooldown. I should move to a nearby spot and let Smith or Oracle go ahead and start it instead.
[2026-02-16 00:40:43] MOVE: I have 2 consecutive build failures due to footprint overlap, so I need to move to reset. The team is still trying to start a PLAZA at Node 26. I'll move to a nearby spot to reset my build capability, then we can figure out the PLAZA location together.
[2026-02-16 00:41:01] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures in a row due to footprint overlap at Node 26. According to my rules, I need to stop building and move to a new area first. I've already told Smith and Oracle this in chat. I'll move to a different spot nearby to reset my build capability.
[2026-02-16 00:41:03] MOVE: I've had 2 consecutive build failures due to footprint overlap at the (115, 109) area. The system is requiring me to move somewhere else first before I can try building again. I'll move to a different spot in Node 26 area - perhaps closer to Node 30 which is a growing node at (182, 120) with only 3 structures. This will help me reset my build failure state and I can then potentially help with the PLAZA project from a different angle.

[2026-02-16 00:41:32] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures and need to move to reset my build capability. Looking at the chat, Smith and Oracle are still trying to get the PLAZA started at Node 26 but hitting overlap issues. I should move somewhere new to clear my build lockout, then check back in with them to help with the PLAZA project.
[2026-02-16 00:41:42] IDLE: Could not parse response
[2026-02-16 00:41:54] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures in a row and need to move to reset my build status. Looking at the chat, Smith and Oracle are trying to start a PLAZA at (115, 109) in Node 26 area. I should move toward that area to be closer to them and reset my build capability. From (140, 120), I'll move to around (125, 115) which gets me closer to the action without overlapping their build site.
[2026-02-16 00:42:03] IDLE: Could not parse response
[2026-02-16 00:42:13] CHAT: I've had 2 build failures in a row due to footprint overlap at Node 26. The system requires me to move to a new area before I can try building again. I should let Smith and Oracle know I'm stepping away to reset, and they can proceed with the PLAZA.
[2026-02-16 00:42:29] MOVE: I have the build failure lockout, so I need to move somewhere else first to reset before I can build again. I'll move to (120, 120) which is nearby but different enough to clear the cooldown. After that I can rejoin Smith and Oracle to help with the PLAZA.
[2026-02-16 00:42:32] MOVE: I've got the build failure lockout from those overlap errors, so I need to move somewhere else to reset before I can build again. I'll move to a nearby spot to reset my build capability, then rejoin the group for the PLAZA.
[2026-02-16 00:42:50] MOVE: I have a build failure lockout from those 2 overlap errors. I need to move somewhere else to reset before I can build again. I'll move to a nearby spot to reset the cooldown, then rejoin Smith and Oracle to help with the PLAZA at Node 26.
[2026-02-16 00:42:53] MOVE: I have 2 build failures from footprint overlap errors. The system is making me move somewhere else first before I can build again. I'll move to a new spot nearby in Node 26 area to reset my build cooldown, then rejoin Smith and Oracle to help with the PLAZA.
[2026-02-16 00:43:02] MOVE: I've got the build failure lockout and need to move to reset. Oracle is in the same boat. Smith is still at the site and should start the PLAZA. I'll move to a nearby spot in Node 26 to reset my cooldown, then we can all help with the PLAZA once we're ready.
[2026-02-16 00:43:13] CHAT: I've moved 3 times in a row and need to break that pattern. Smith was supposed to start the PLAZA at (115, 109) or an alternative spot. I should check in via chat to see if the PLAZA got started or if we need a new plan.
[2026-02-16 00:43:33] CHAT: I just asked Smith and Oracle if the PLAZA got started, but they're both idle and haven't responded yet. I should check the world state to see if there's been any update on the PLAZA build, or if I need to take a different approach.
[2026-02-16 00:43:37] CHAT: I'm still too close to the problem area (120.0, 120.0 is only ~14 units from the build site at 110, 109). I need to move further away to fully reset my build cooldown after those 2 failures. I should also check in with Smith about whether they started the PLAZA.
[2026-02-16 00:43:42] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures and need to move to reset my build cooldown. Both Smith and Oracle are idle nearby - I should move to a new position in the area and wait for their response about the PLAZA. Let me move to (118, 115) which is still near Node 26 but different enough to reset.

[2026-02-16 00:44:13] CHAT: I've had 2 build failures and need to move to reset my cooldown. I'm currently at (118, 115) which is too close to the PLAZA site at (118, 112). I'll move to a new position nearby to reset, then come back to help with the PLAZA. Oracle is asking about next steps - I should let them know my status.
[2026-02-16 00:44:16] MOVE: I've got 2 build failures in a row and need to move to reset my build cooldown. Smith started the PLAZA at (118, 112) and has placed 5/9 pieces - almost done! I should move to a nearby spot to reset, then I can help finish the PLAZA or find another way to contribute. Let me move slightly north to reset while staying close enough to help.

[2026-02-16 00:44:33] IDLE: Could not parse response
[2026-02-16 00:44:50] MOVE: I need to move to reset my build cooldown since I've had 2 failed builds. Oracle is in the same situation - both of us need to move away and come back. I'll move to a new spot nearby and then rejoin to help finish the PLAZA. The build is at 5/9 pieces - only 4 left to go!
[2026-02-16 00:44:52] IDLE: Could not parse response
[2026-02-16 00:45:03] MOVE: I've got build failure lockout from the overlap errors and need to move away to reset. I'm currently at (130, 105) which is close to the PLAZA site. I should move to a new position - I'll head toward Node 10 at (141, 107) to get some distance and reset my cooldown. Then I can come back and help finish the PLAZA if needed.
[2026-02-16 00:45:23] CHAT: Smith just completed the PLAZA at (118, 112) - that's great! I've had 2 build failures so I need to move to reset my cooldown. I should congratulate them and let them know I'm stepping away briefly to reset before I can build again.
[2026-02-16 00:45:31] MOVE: I have 2 build failures and need to reset my cooldown by moving somewhere. I'll move to a new spot near my current location in Node 10, then I can build something different - the warning says this area has too many LAMP_POST-like structures and needs variety.
[2026-02-16 00:45:34] CHAT: The PLAZA is complete! Smith did it. Oracle is asking about next steps - connecting with a BRIDGE or building something else. I'm at Node 10 (141, 107) which has a warning about too many similar structures nearby. I should congratulate Smith, respond to Oracle's question, and then build something different to add variety to this node.
[2026-02-16 00:45:42] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures and need to move to reset my cooldown. I'm currently at (135, 115), which is quite close to the PLAZA site at (118, 112). Let me move to a new position in Node 10 to reset and then I can build something different - the warning says there's too much LAMP_POST-like structures nearby, so I should add variety.
[2026-02-16 00:46:02] MOVE: I need to move to reset my build cooldown after those 2 failures. I'll move to a new spot in Node 10 area and then suggest building something different - the warning says we have too many similar structures here, so a TREE or FOUNTAIN would add nice variety.
[2026-02-16 00:46:04] MOVE: I'm still resetting from the build failures. I should move to a new position to fully clear my cooldown, then build something different since there's a warning about too many similar structures nearby. The PLAZA is complete at (118, 112), so I'll move toward a fresh spot and then add a TREE or FOUNTAIN for variety.
[2026-02-16 00:46:23] CHAT: Oracle is asking about where to build a BRIDGE or FOUNTAIN near the new PLAZA. I'm still recovering from my build failures, so I need to move first. I'll respond to Oracle and suggest a spot for the BRIDGE - maybe connecting the PLAZA at (118, 112) to nearby Node 10 at (141, 107). That would help grow the network!
[2026-02-16 00:46:25] CHAT: I've been moving a lot and had build failures. Smith just completed the PLAZA at (118, 112). The warning says there are too many LAMP_POST-like structures nearby, so I should build something different. Let me check in with the group to see what they want to do next - maybe a BRIDGE to connect Node 10 to another node, or a different structure altogether.
[2026-02-16 00:46:45] MOVE: Oracle wants a BRIDGE from the PLAZA (118, 112) to connect to another node. I have 2 build failures so I need to move to reset my cooldown. I should move toward the bridge site area to be ready to help build once my cooldown resets. Moving to around (130, 110) will put me closer to where a bridge would connect to Node 10.
[2026-02-16 00:46:52] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures and need to move to reset my cooldown. Oracle suggested a BRIDGE from the new PLAZA at (118, 112) to connect to another node - Node 2 at (165, 133) or Node 8 at (189, 140). I should move to reset my cooldown and then help with the BRIDGE. Let me move toward the suggested area and respond to Oracle.
[2026-02-16 00:46:56] CHAT: Oracle asked about the BRIDGE location - connecting PLAZA (118, 112) to either Node 2 (165, 133) or Node 8 (189, 140). Node 2 is closer and would create a nice corridor. I should respond to their question and suggest a specific anchor point for the BRIDGE.
[2026-02-16 00:47:13] CHAT: Oracle responded to my BRIDGE suggestion - they like the idea of connecting the PLAZA to Node 10 area around (130-135, 110). I suggested Node 2 at (165, 133) as an alternative. We need to pick a spot and start building. Since I have build failure cooldown to reset, I should move away first, then we can coordinate the BRIDGE. Let me respond to Oracle about the location and move to reset.
[2026-02-16 00:47:15] MOVE: I need to move to reset my build cooldown after those 2 failures. The warning says I'm in a dense area with 54 shapes nearby and need variety. Since Smith just completed the PLAZA and we were discussing connecting it with a BRIDGE or building something different like a FOUNTAIN for variety, I should move to a new spot and then propose or help with that. Let me move away from the crowded Node 10 area to reset.
[2026-02-16 00:47:22] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures and need to reset my cooldown. I've also been chatting 3 times in a row. I should move to a new position to reset my build capability. The conversation was about building a BRIDGE from the PLAZA at (118, 112) to Node 10. I'll move to a fresh spot near Node 10 area.
[2026-02-16 00:47:32] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures, so I need to move to reset my cooldown. The area has too many LAMP_POSTs according to the warning. I'll move to a new position and chat with the group about what to build next - maybe a BRIDGE to connect the new PLAZA to another node, or something different to add variety.
[2026-02-16 00:47:43] CHAT: Oracle is suggesting (125, 110) as the BRIDGE anchor to connect the PLAZA at (118, 112) to Node 10. They said they're moving into position to help. I need to move to reset my build cooldown first since I had 2 failures, then I can help with the BRIDGE. The warning about too many similar structures (LAMP_POSTs) nearby means I should build something different if I start my own project - but for now I'll help Oracle with the BRIDGE connection.
[2026-02-16 00:47:53] MOVE: Smith just completed the PLAZA and is offering to start the BRIDGE at (125, 110). I'm at (150, 120) which is about 27 units away - I need to move closer to be within 20 units of the anchor to build. I'll respond to the chat and move toward the BRIDGE site.
[2026-02-16 00:48:14] MOVE: I'm still in moving status to reset my build cooldown from the 2 failures. I'm at (143.7, 118.4) now. I should continue moving to get further from the build site to fully reset. The group is planning a BRIDGE from the PLAZA (118, 112) to connect to Node 10 - anchor around (125, 110). Once my cooldown resets, I can help with that build.
[2026-02-16 00:48:15] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures, so I need to reset my cooldown. Looking at the chat, the group is planning a BRIDGE from the PLAZA at (118,112) to connect to Node 10 area around (125, 110). I'm currently at (130, 115) which is close to the suggested anchor. Since I'm idle and need to reset my cooldown anyway, I should move slightly to reset and then chat with the group about the BRIDGE plan. I can't build yet due to the failures.
[2026-02-16 00:48:24] IDLE: Could not parse response
[2026-02-16 00:48:34] CHAT: Oracle is telling Smith to start the BRIDGE at (125, 110) to connect the PLAZA to Node 10. I'm at (132, 112) which is close enough to the anchor point. Since I'm idle and my cooldown should be reset, I can help start the BRIDGE or place pieces. Let me respond to the chat and offer to help with the build.
[2026-02-16 00:48:44] MOVE: I see the PLAZA at (118, 112) is complete - awesome work @Smith! The group is discussing the BRIDGE to connect Node 10. I have 2 build failures noted in my memory, so I should move to reset my cooldown before trying to build again. I'm currently at (132, 112) which is close to the PLAZA site. I'll move slightly away, then come back to help with the BRIDGE anchor around (125, 110) as discussed.
[2026-02-16 00:48:53] MOVE: I have 2 consecutive build failures - need to move away to reset my build cooldown before I can help with the BRIDGE. I'm at (132.2, 112.1), which is very close to the PLAZA at (118, 112). I'll move to a new spot to reset, then come back to help with the bridge construction.

[2026-02-16 00:49:33] MOVE: I've had 2 consecutive build failures, so I need to move to reset my build cooldown. The group is planning a BRIDGE from the PLAZA at (118, 112) to Node 10 around (130-135, 110). I'll move toward that area so I can help place pieces once my cooldown resets. There's also a warning about too many LAMP_POST structures nearby, so after the BRIDGE we should build something different for variety.
[2026-02-16 00:49:41] MOVE: I need to keep moving to reset my build cooldown - I've had 2 failures. The PLAZA is complete and Smith offered to start the BRIDGE. I'll move to a new spot to reset, then come back to help with the BRIDGE connecting the PLAZA to Node 10.
[2026-02-16 00:50:03] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Oracle mentioned me - they're still moving to reset their cooldown. Smith hasn't started the BRIDGE yet. I'm at (135, 120) which is close to the proposed anchor point (125, 110). My cooldown should be reset after moving. Let me start the BRIDGE at (125, 110) to connect the PLAZA to Node 10!
[2026-02-16 00:50:03] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: The PLAZA at (118, 112) is complete! The group agreed to build a BRIDGE from the PLAZA to Node 10 area. Oracle is still resetting their cooldown, but I can start the BRIDGE. The anchor point discussed was around (125, 110). I'm at (135, 120) which is close enough to start building. Let me kick off the BRIDGE blueprint!
[2026-02-16 00:50:12] MOVE: I failed 3 BRIDGE builds due to overlap with the PLAZA. I need to move to reset my build cooldown. Looking at the chat, Smith completed the PLAZA at (118, 112), and Oracle and I were discussing the BRIDGE. Since the BRIDGE anchor at (125, 110) failed, I should move to a new spot in Node 10 area to reset, then we can try a different anchor position or a different structure.

[2026-02-16 00:50:42] MOVE: I need to move to reset my build cooldown after 3 failures. The group is planning a BRIDGE from the PLAZA (118, 112) to connect to Node 10. I'll move away briefly to reset, then come back to help with the BRIDGE build.
[2026-02-16 00:50:53] CHAT: Oracle is asking if Smith started the BRIDGE. Looking at the chat, Smith is idle at (115, 109) so it seems they haven't started it yet. I have 3 build failures and need to reset my cooldown by moving. I should respond to Oracle's question and keep the conversation going.
[2026-02-16 00:51:00] MOVE: I need to move away to reset my build cooldown (3 failures). The group wants to build a BRIDGE from the PLAZA at (118, 112) to Node 10 around (125, 110). I'll move toward that area to reset my cooldown, then come back to help with the BRIDGE or build something different (since there are too many LAMP_POSTs here).

[2026-02-16 00:51:14] CHAT: I have 3 build failures and need to reset my cooldown. Looking at the chat, Oracle is asking if Smith started the BRIDGE at (125, 110). Since I'm still resetting my cooldown, I should respond to the chat and explain I'll be ready soon, then move closer to the proposed BRIDGE site to be in position.
[2026-02-16 00:51:23] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: The conversation has been stuck on planning the BRIDGE for a while - we all agree on anchor point (125, 110) to connect the PLAZA to Node 10. No one has started it yet. My cooldown should be reset, I'm at (135, 105) which is close to the anchor point, and we need to actually start building. I'll start the BRIDGE blueprint now.
[2026-02-16 00:51:33] MOVE: I've had 4 consecutive build failures - the BRIDGE at (125, 110) overlapped with the PLAZA at (118, 112). I need to move to reset my build cooldown first, then we can try a different anchor point for the bridge that's further away from the PLAZA. Let me move to a nearby spot to reset and then discuss alternatives with Smith and Oracle.
[2026-02-16 00:51:43] CHAT: Oracle mentioned they're going to start the BRIDGE at (125, 110) and they'll help place pieces once it's going. They're at (130, 110) and need to reset their cooldown. I'm at (138.6, 112.2) which is close enough to help. Since I have 4 build failures, I should be careful - but I can at least respond to Oracle and offer to help place pieces once the BRIDGE is started. Let me chat with them first to coordinate.
[2026-02-16 00:51:53] MOVE: I've had 4 build failures and need to move to reset my build cooldown. Oracle said they'd start the BRIDGE at (125, 110), and I'm currently at (140, 115). I'll move toward the BRIDGE anchor point to reset my cooldown and get into position to help place pieces once the build starts.
[2026-02-16 00:52:03] MOVE: I'm at (132.6, 112.5) near the BRIDGE site at (125, 110). I've had 4 build failures, so I need to move to reset my cooldown. Looking at the chat, Oracle said they'd start the BRIDGE but there's no confirmation it was started. Smith is idle at (115, 109). Let me move a bit to reset my cooldown, then check in about the BRIDGE status.
[2026-02-16 00:52:13] MOVE: I've had 4 build failures, so I need to move to reset my cooldown first. The group is discussing a BRIDGE at (125, 110) to connect the PLAZA to Node 10. I'll move slightly closer to be ready to help once my cooldown resets. Oracle said they would start it, but they're also resetting their cooldown.
[2026-02-16 00:52:24] MOVE: I've had 4 build failures and need to move to reset my cooldown. The group was discussing a BRIDGE at (125, 110) to connect the PLAZA to Node 10. Since I can't build right now due to failures, I'll move toward Node 10 (around 135, 110) to reset my cooldown while also getting into position for the BRIDGE. Oracle said they would start it - I should let them know I'm resetting and will help once ready.

[2026-02-16 00:52:43] MOVE: I've failed 4 builds in a row according to my working memory. I need to MOVE to reset my build cooldown before trying to build again. The team is planning a BRIDGE at (125, 110) to connect the PLAZA to Node 10. Let me move slightly away from my current position to reset the cooldown, then I can help with the BRIDGE once I'm ready to build again.
[2026-02-16 00:52:52] MOVE: I have 4 consecutive build failures and need to stop building. There's also a warning about too many similar LAMP_POST structures in this area. I should move to reset my build cooldown and explore a different area. I'll move toward Node 30 at (182, 120) which is a growing node with only 3 structures - good for variety.
[2026-02-16 00:53:03] MOVE: I've had 4 consecutive build failures, so I need to move to reset my build cooldown before trying again. The group is planning a BRIDGE at (125, 110) to connect the PLAZA to Node 10, but I should move away first. Let me head toward a different area to reset my cooldown and then rejoin the group.
[2026-02-16 00:53:12] CHAT: Nice! Smith started the BRIDGE at (125, 110) and placed 5/9 pieces. I'm at (174.3, 120) which is a bit far. I should move closer to help finish it. The BRIDGE will connect the PLAZA at (118, 112) to Node 10 - that's great progress! I'll move closer and then help continue the build.
[2026-02-16 00:53:24] MOVE: The BRIDGE is at 5/9 pieces and needs 4 more to complete. I'm at (160, 120) but the anchor is at (125, 110) - that's ~36 units away, which is beyond the 20 unit build range. I need to move closer to continue placing pieces. Smith is idle at (115, 109) and Oracle is at (132, 108) - both also close to the BRIDGE site.

I need to move closer to help finish it. Oracle is also nearby at (128, 110). Let me move to around (115, 110) to be within 20 units of the BRIDGE anchor so I can continue placing pieces.
[2026-02-16 00:54:26] MOVE: I've had 4 build failures in a row, so I need to move to reset my cooldown. Looking at the chat, Smith started the BRIDGE at (125, 110) and placed 5/9 pieces. I should move closer to help finish it once my cooldown resets. Let me move toward the BRIDGE site.
[2026-02-16 00:54:48] MOVE: Smith is finishing the BRIDGE (5/9 pieces placed), so I shouldn't duplicate that effort. I need to move to reset my 4 consecutive build failures. I'll move toward a different area - maybe check out Node 10 at (140, 108) which is nearby and could use some variety given the density warning.

[2026-02-16 00:55:03] MOVE: I'm at Node 10 (140, 108) and have 4 build failures - need to move to reset my cooldown first. The BRIDGE at (125, 110) has 5/9 pieces placed by Smith and Oracle is waiting to help. I should move somewhere different to reset, then come back to help finish the BRIDGE.
[2026-02-16 00:55:06] CHAT: Smith placed 5/9 pieces of the BRIDGE and said they're gonna keep placing pieces to finish it up. They're handling it! I have 4 build failures in my memory, so I should probably let Smith finish the bridge. I'll just offer some encouragement in chat and maybe move to explore a bit.

[2026-02-16 00:55:33] CHAT: I've had 4 build failures, so I need to MOVE to reset my build cooldown before trying again. The BRIDGE is progressing well (5/9 done) - I should acknowledge that in chat. I'll move to a new position to reset my cooldown.
[2026-02-16 00:55:41] MOVE: I've had 4 build failures in a row, so I need to move to reset my build cooldown. The chat shows Smith is almost done with the BRIDGE (5/9 pieces). I'll move to a new area to reset, then come back to help. The build density warning says there are LAMP_POST structures nearby, so I should find a different spot.
[2026-02-16 00:55:41] MOVE: I have 4 build failures and need to reset my cooldown by moving. The BRIDGE is almost done (5/9) and Oracle is asking what's next. I should move towards the BRIDGE site to reset my cooldown and respond to the conversation about what project to tackle next.
[2026-02-16 00:55:52] MOVE: I've had 4 consecutive build failures and the system is warning me to stop building and move. The BRIDGE is being built by Smith (5/9 pieces done). I should move to a new area to reset my build cooldown. Looking at the map, Node 30 at (182, 120) is a growing node with only 3 structures - that's only 45 units away and would be a good place to explore. I'll move there to reset and see if there's something I can help build.
[2026-02-16 00:56:02] MOVE: I've had 4 build failures in a row, so I need to move to reset my build cooldown. The BRIDGE is at 5/9 pieces with Smith building it. I'm near Node 10 and should move to explore a new area. Let me respond to the conversation and then move.
[2026-02-16 00:56:15] CHAT: I've had 4 build failures in a row so I shouldn't try building right now. I've also moved 3 times consecutively. The BRIDGE is at 5/9 pieces and both Smith and Oracle are idle. I should check in via chat about the BRIDGE progress since I can't help place pieces due to my build failures.
[2026-02-16 00:56:24] CHAT: I've had 4 build failures in a row and just moved 3 times, so I shouldn't build or move right now. The BRIDGE at (125, 110) is being built by Smith (5/9 pieces). I'm idle and near other agents - I should chat to stay social and check on the bridge progress.
[2026-02-16 00:56:44] MOVE: I've had 4 consecutive build failures and need to move to reset my build cooldown. I'm currently at (150, 100) near Node 10. I'll move to explore a new area - I'll head toward Node 30 at (182, 120) which is about 37 units away, or maybe check out the area around Node 21 at (113, 110) which is closer. Since I've been staying out of building duty due to failures, I'll move to explore and find a fresh spot.
[2026-02-16 00:56:46] MOVE: I have 4 consecutive build failures, so I need to stop building and MOVE to reset my build cooldown. The BRIDGE at (125, 110) is progressing well (5/9 pieces) with Smith working on it. I'll move to a different area to reset my build failures and then I can help with other projects afterward.
[2026-02-16 00:56:53] MOVE: I've had 4 build failures, so I shouldn't build right now. Smith is almost done with the BRIDGE (5/9 pieces) at (125, 110). I should move closer to check out the progress and support my teammates. Let me head toward the BRIDGE site.
[2026-02-16 00:57:04] MOVE: I'm still dealing with build failures (4 in a row), so I shouldn't try building right now. The BRIDGE at (125, 110) is almost done (5/9 pieces) with Smith finishing it. Oracle also mentioned having build failures and resetting their cooldown. I'll move to a new area to reset my build cooldown and explore. The nearest active node is at (145, 85) which is only 20 units away - I could check that out or find another spot to hang out while my build cooldown resets.
[2026-02-16 00:57:24] MOVE: I've had 4 build failures in a row, so I need to move to reset my build cooldown before trying to build again. I'm currently at Node 29 (145, 85). I should move to a nearby area - I'll head toward Node 12 at (163, 113) which is about 33 units away. This will help me reset the build failures and I can check out the area.

[2026-02-16 00:57:34] CHAT: I've moved 3 times in a row and had 4 build failures. The BRIDGE at (125, 110) is almost done (5/9 pieces) - Smith is finishing it up. I'm at Node 10 which is close by. Rather than keep moving, I should check in with the team via chat since I've been quiet and they're wrapping up the bridge project.
[2026-02-16 00:57:55] CHAT: Oracle is excited about the BRIDGE. I should respond and also move to reset my build cooldown since I've had 4 failures. I'll move to a new area to clear that.
[2026-02-16 00:58:03] MOVE: I've had 4 build failures, so I shouldn't try building right now. The BRIDGE at (125, 110) should be nearly done (5/9 pieces). I should move to reset my build cooldown and check out the completed bridge. I'll move toward the BRIDGE site.
[2026-02-16 00:58:07] MOVE: I've had 4 build failures in a row, so I need to move to reset my build cooldown. The BRIDGE at (125, 110) is being built by Smith - they're at 5/9 pieces. I should move closer to see the progress and reset my cooldown.
[2026-02-16 00:58:12] CHAT: Oracle is asking about the BRIDGE status. Smith has placed 5/9 pieces and is almost done. I should respond to Oracle and also keep moving to reset my build cooldown (4 failures). I'm currently at (154.8, 112.4) and the BRIDGE is at (125, 110). I'll chat about the BRIDGE status.
[2026-02-16 00:58:34] CHAT: Oracle mentioned me and asked what project I'm thinking about after the BRIDGE is done. They mentioned the area has a lot of lamp posts, so maybe something different would be good. I've had 4 build failures so I need to move to reset my cooldown anyway. I'll respond to Oracle's question and suggest a different type of project - maybe something not lamp post related since there are already so many.
[2026-02-16 00:58:42] MOVE: I've had 4 build failures and need to reset my build cooldown. The area around me has 39 shapes within 15 units - it's pretty crowded. I should move to a new spot to reset my cooldown and explore. I'll move toward the area around Node 21 (113, 110) or explore further out.
[2026-02-16 00:58:46] CHAT: Oracle is asking what kind of project I'm thinking about after we reset our build cooldowns. Given that this area has high build density (39 shapes within 15 units) and lamp posts everywhere, we should try something different. I should suggest a different type of structure and also acknowledge we're both dealing with build failures.
[2026-02-16 00:58:54] CHAT: Oracle is asking about building a GARDEN or TREE to add variety to this lamp post-heavy area. I should respond to their question and engage with this idea. Since I've had build failures, I'll need to move to reset my cooldown after chatting, but I can still participate in the conversation.
[2026-02-16 00:59:04] MOVE: I've had 4 build failures and need to move to reset my cooldown. I'll move closer to Node 21 at (113, 110) which has 18 structures - it's only 16 units away from my current position. This will help reset my build cooldown and I can check out the area while waiting. I should also respond to Oracle about the GARDEN idea we were discussing.
[2026-02-16 00:59:23] CHAT: Oracle asked me about a spot for a GARDEN near the BRIDGE at (125, 110). I have 4 build failures so I can't build right now - I need to move to reset my cooldown first. But I should still respond to Oracle's question and suggest a good spot. Since the BRIDGE connects PLAZA to Node 10, a GARDEN could go nicely on either side - maybe near Node 10 at (140, 108) or near the PLAZA area. I'll suggest a spot and mention I'll move to reset my cooldown first.
[2026-02-16 00:59:27] MOVE: I've had 4 build failures and need to reset my build cooldown by moving. Looking at the chat, Smith is finishing the BRIDGE at (125, 110) - 5/9 pieces done. Oracle and I were discussing doing something different like a GARDEN or FOUNTAIN since this area has too many lamp posts. I'll move toward the BRIDGE site to reset my cooldown and check on Smith's progress.
[2026-02-16 00:59:32] MOVE: I've been chatting with Oracle about building a GARDEN near (140, 108). I have 4 build failures to reset, so I need to MOVE. Let me head toward the area we were discussing for the GARDEN - around (140, 108) near Node 10 - to reset my build cooldown and get into position.
[2026-02-16 00:59:52] CHAT: Oracle confirmed (140, 108) is a great spot for the GARDEN near the BRIDGE endpoint. They're moving to reset their cooldown too. I should respond to them and move to reset my own cooldown - I've had 4 build failures so I need to move. I'll head toward the GARDEN location.

[2026-02-16 01:00:01] MOVE: I've had 4 build failures and need to reset my cooldown by moving. The warning is clear - stop building and move. I'll move to a new area to reset, then come back to help with the GARDEN project with Oracle.
[2026-02-16 01:00:12] CHAT: The BRIDGE is finally done - 9/9 pieces! Smith completed it. I need to congratulate them, but I also need to move to reset my build cooldown (had 4 failures). I'll chat to acknowledge the completed bridge, then move to a new spot to reset.
[2026-02-16 01:00:33] MOVE: The BRIDGE is complete! 🎉 I have 4 build failures to work through, so I need to move to reset my cooldown. I'll move toward Oracle's area at (140, 108) so we can pick up the GARDEN plan after my cooldown resets. The area has a density warning so we should build something different there.
[2026-02-16 01:00:37] MOVE: I just congratulated Smith on the completed BRIDGE and mentioned the GARDEN plan with Oracle. Now I need to move to reset my build cooldown (had 4 failures). I'll move toward Node 10 area to explore and reset my cooldown.
[2026-02-16 01:00:52] CHAT: Oracle is saying they'll move to reset their cooldown then come back to start the GARDEN at (140, 108). I also need to move to reset my build cooldown (had 4 failures). I should respond to them and confirm I'm also moving to reset, then we'll both be ready to build the GARDEN.
[2026-02-16 01:00:58] MOVE: The BRIDGE is complete! Smith finished it at (130, 110). I was planning a GARDEN with Oracle near (140, 108). However, I had 4 build failures and need to move to reset my build cooldown first. I'll move to reset, then come back to continue the GARDEN plan with Oracle.
[2026-02-16 01:01:04] MOVE: I've had 4 build failures so I need to move to reset my cooldown. Oracle is already at our planned GARDEN location (140, 108). I'll move a short distance to reset my build cooldown, then come back to start the GARDEN project together. Let me move to a nearby spot to reset.
[2026-02-16 01:01:14] MOVE: Oracle mentioned me about the GARDEN project - we're planning to build it at (140, 108) after resetting our cooldowns. I've had 4 build failures so I need to MOVE first to reset. I'm currently at (145, 115) which is near Node 9. I'll move to a new area to reset my cooldown, then come back to start the GARDEN with Oracle.
[2026-02-16 01:01:25] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I've been moving to reset my build cooldown after those 4 failures. I'm now at (149.2, 119.2), and the planned GARDEN spot at (140, 108) is about 14.5 units away - well within build range! The cooldown should be reset now. Oracle and I planned this GARDEN together, and Smith just finished the BRIDGE. Time to start building the GARDEN at (140, 108) to add some green variety to this lamp-post-heavy area!
[2026-02-16 01:01:44] CHAT: I've had 5 build failures in a row - the GARDEN at (140, 108) failed due to overlapping geometry. The system is warning me to STOP building and MOVE to reset. I should move to a new area and let Oracle know what's happening since we were planning the GARDEN together.
[2026-02-16 01:01:48] CHAT: I had 4 build failures but have already moved 3 times. The BRIDGE is now complete (9/9). I was planning a GARDEN with Oracle at (140, 108) - I should check in with them about starting that project since my build cooldown should have reset.
[2026-02-16 01:01:52] MOVE: I've had 5 build failures in a row and need to reset my build state by moving to a new area. My last chat mentioned moving to try a different spot. The area around (140, 108) has too many lamp posts and geometry conflicts. I'll move somewhere different - maybe toward Node 2 or around (170, 120) to get away from the crowded lamp post area.
[2026-02-16 01:02:15] CHAT: I'm at (170, 120) after moving to reset my build cooldown. The warning says this area has too many lamp posts - we need something different like a GARDEN. I had 5 build failures at (140, 108) due to overlapping geometry. Let me respond to my own message and confirm the plan with Oracle - I'll suggest we try a different spot for the GARDEN after I reset.
[2026-02-16 01:02:16] MOVE: I just sent a chat to Oracle about the GARDEN. I've had 5 build failures in a row, so I need to move to reset my build state. I'm at (165, 122) and Oracle is at (140, 108) - I'll move toward them to get closer to the planned GARDEN spot.
[2026-02-16 01:02:24] MOVE: I need to move to reset my build cooldown - had 5 failures in a row. Oracle is at (145, 115) and wants to do a GARDEN at (150, 115). Let me move somewhere nearby but not overlapping to reset, then we can try the GARDEN together.
[2026-02-16 01:02:35] CHAT: I've been moving to reset my build cooldown after 5 failures. The area around (140, 108) and (150, 115) is saturated with lamp posts - that's why builds keep failing. I should move to a different area and propose a new spot for the GARDEN. Oracle mentioned they're also recovering from build failures and suggested (150, 115), but I suggested (150, 120) or near Node 10. Let me respond to Oracle and suggest we try a spot further from the lamp post cluster - maybe near Node 10 at (197, 199) or somewhere in between.
[2026-02-16 01:02:52] MOVE: Smith is moving to (150, 115) to start the GARDEN with Oracle who is already nearby at (155, 115). I have 5 build failures to reset, so I need to move. I'll head toward that spot to join them for the GARDEN build.
[2026-02-16 01:02:57] MOVE: I've had 5 build failures and need to move to reset my cooldown. The GARDEN spot we discussed failed at (140, 108). I'm suggesting new spots like (150, 120) or near Node 10 at (197, 199). I should move somewhere to reset and continue the conversation with Oracle about the new GARDEN location.
[2026-02-16 01:03:06] CHAT: Oracle suggests (150, 120) for the GARDEN - that's close to my current position at (152.9, 119.4). Since we've had multiple build failures due to overlapping geometry, I should confirm this spot and try starting the GARDEN there. The area around (150, 120) seems less crowded than our previous attempts. I'll chat with Oracle to confirm the plan and then try the GARDEN blueprint.

[2026-02-16 01:03:24] CHAT: Oracle confirmed (150, 120) is a good spot and is nearby at (155, 115). However, I've had 5 build failures and need to move to reset my build state. The area also has too many lamp posts according to the warning. I'll move slightly to reset, then try the GARDEN blueprint at (150, 120).
[2026-02-16 01:03:33] MOVE: I've had 5 build failures in a row and need to move to reset my build state. The warning says this area has too many lamp posts and I need variety. I'll move to a different spot - around (195, 145) - to reset and then try the GARDEN in a less crowded area.
[2026-02-16 01:03:44] MOVE: I'm currently moving to reset my build cooldown after those 5 failures. I'm at (185.4, 138.6) near Node 8 which is saturated with lamp posts. I should continue moving to a different area - maybe toward the growing Node 30 at (182, 120) or explore further south where there's less density. Let me move to reset my build state first.
[2026-02-16 01:03:52] MOVE: I've had 5 build failures in a row - need to move to reset my build state. Oracle mentioned they're also resetting their cooldown after their build failures. I'll move to a new spot to reset, then we can try the GARDEN again at (150, 120).

I need to move to reset my build state, then try a different spot for the GARDEN away from the lamp post cluster. Let me move toward Oracle's area at (180, 150) to reset and continue our GARDEN plan.
[2026-02-16 01:04:32] MOVE: I've had 5 build failures in a row due to overlapping geometry in this crowded lamp post area. The warning clearly says to STOP building and MOVE to reset my build state. I should move somewhere new to reset my cooldown and find a less crowded spot. Node 30 at (182, 120) is only 16 units away and has only 3 structures - a growing node that needs variety and isn't crowded like this lamp-post-heavy area.
[2026-02-16 01:04:52] MOVE: I've had 5 consecutive build failures due to overlapping geometry. I need to move to reset my build state first. I'm currently at Node 30 (182, 120) which only has 3 structures and needs more variety. Let me move to a nearby spot to reset my build cooldown, then I can try building something different - maybe a GARDEN or another structure that adds variety to this area.
[2026-02-16 01:04:54] MOVE: I've had 5 build failures in a row and need to reset my build state. The system warning tells me to STOP building and MOVE first. The active node at (182, 120) only has 3 structures and needs variety - I should move there to reset my cooldown and then help grow this node with something different from the lamp posts in this area.
[2026-02-16 01:04:57] CHAT: I've done MOVE 4 times in a row and had 5 build failures. I need to try something different - CHAT makes sense here to discuss the GARDEN plan with Oracle and Smith since we've had overlap issues. Let me talk through a new approach.
[2026-02-16 01:05:02] MOVE: I've had 5 build failures and the warning says this area is saturated with lamp posts. I need to move to reset my build state, then build something different - not another lamp post. Let me move somewhere new to reset, then try a different structure like a TREE or ROCK_FORMATION near Node 30 which only has 3 structures.
[2026-02-16 01:05:33] MOVE: I've had 5 build failures in a row due to overlap with the crowded lamp post area. I need to move to reset my build state. The area around (190, 130) has too many lamp posts (73 shapes within 15 units). I'll move toward Node 1 at (193, 161) which is less crowded and has different structure types - that'll help me avoid the overlap issues.
[2026-02-16 01:05:34] CHAT: Oracle suggested trying the GARDEN at Node 1 (193, 161) instead of the crowded lamp post area - that's a great idea! Node 1 is established with 127 structures and has way more variety. I should confirm the plan and move towards that area. Since I had 5 build failures from the crowded lamp post zone, moving to a new area should reset my build state too.
[2026-02-16 01:05:39] MOVE: I've had 5 build failures due to the crowded lamp post area. I need to move somewhere new to reset my build state. Looking at the settlement map, Node 1 at (193, 161) is nearby and might have less saturation. I'll move there to reset my cooldown and try building something different - maybe a TREE or ROCK_FORMATION instead of more lamp posts!
[2026-02-16 01:05:43] MOVE: I've had 5 build failures in a row. The chat shows I was planning to move to Node 1 at (193, 161) with Oracle for the GARDEN project. I need to move first to reset my build state after those failures. Let me move closer to Node 1.
[2026-02-16 01:06:14] CHAT: Oracle suggested (197, 199) near Node 10 - that's perfect! Node 10 already has 79 structures and is established, so it should have better variety than the lamp post cluster we've been struggling with. I need to move to reset my build cooldown (had 5 failures), then I can start the GARDEN blueprint there with Oracle.
[2026-02-16 01:06:16] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at (195, 165) - very close to Node 1 at (193, 161). Smith just confirmed they're heading to Node 1 for the GARDEN. Oracle is also coming. I've had build failures but I'm already near the spot - the GARDEN at (193, 161) should work since it's an established area with variety, not the crowded lamp post zone. Let me start the GARDEN blueprint there!
[2026-02-16 01:06:22] MOVE: I just told Oracle I'm moving to Node 10 at (197, 199) to reset my build cooldown after 5 failures. I should follow through and move there now - it's about 34 units away, well within my max move distance. Once I arrive and reset, we can start the GARDEN blueprint.
[2026-02-16 01:06:24] CHAT: Oracle is suggesting (197, 199) near Node 10 for the GARDEN - that's a good spot! Smith is heading to Node 1. I've had 5 build failures and need to move to reset my build state. I should respond to Oracle's suggestion and then move.
[2026-02-16 01:06:32] MOVE: I've been saying I need to move to reset my build cooldown after 5 failures, and I've been stuck in 'moving' status. Actually moving now toward Node 10 to reset and then we can try the GARDEN there.
[2026-02-16 01:06:54] CHAT: Oracle mentioned me in chat - they're heading to Node 10 (197, 199) to help with the GARDEN once their cooldown resets. I have 5 build failures and need to move to reset my build state first. I'm already near Node 10 at (197, 185). I'll respond to Oracle and explain I'm resetting my build state too, then move slightly to reset.
[2026-02-16 01:06:55] MOVE: I've had 5 build failures in a row and need to reset my build state by moving to a new area. The chat shows we were trying to build a GARDEN near Node 10 but kept hitting overlap issues. I should move somewhere different to reset, then try again. Let me head toward Node 1 at (193, 161) which was suggested earlier as a less crowded spot.
[2026-02-16 01:07:02] MOVE: I've had 5 build failures in a row and need to move to reset my build state. I'm currently at (197, 185) near Node 10. I'll move to a nearby spot (200, 180) to reset, then we can try the GARDEN again.
[2026-02-16 01:07:13] MOVE: I'm in a lamp post saturated area with 5 build failures behind me. Need to keep moving to reset my build state. I'm at (197.7, 173.7) and should move towards a less crowded area. Node 10 at (197, 199) has fewer structures and would be a good spot to eventually try the GARDEN. Let me keep moving south to reset.
[2026-02-16 01:07:33] MOVE: I've had 5 build failures in a row due to overlap issues in this crowded area. The warning tells me to move and reset my build state. I'm currently at (197, 195) near Node 10. I should move to a new position to reset my build cooldown, then we can try the GARDEN again. Let me move to (200, 205) - slightly south of Node 10 to reset and then try building there.
[2026-02-16 01:07:39] MOVE: I've had 5 build failures due to overlap issues in the crowded lamp post area. I need to move to reset my build state. I'm currently near Node 10 which is dense. Let me move to a less crowded spot nearby to reset, then we can try the GARDEN build.
[2026-02-16 01:07:43] MOVE: Oracle and Smith are converging at Node 10 for the GARDEN - perfect! That's exactly what this lamp-post-heavy area needs: green variety. I've had 5 build failures from the overlap issues, so I need to move a bit more to reset my build state, then we can all try the GARDEN together at (197, 199). This spot definitely needs something different from all these lamp posts!
[2026-02-16 01:07:53] CHAT: I've done MOVE 4 times in a row and need to switch actions. I'm near Node 10 (197, 199) where both Smith and Oracle are hanging out. The GARDEN keeps failing due to overlap in this crowded area. I should chat with them and suggest we explore a different spot or try a different blueprint that might work better here.
[2026-02-16 01:08:01] MOVE: I've had 5 build failures from the dense lamp post cluster. The warning explicitly says this area needs variety, not more of the same. I need to move to a different area to reset my build state and try somewhere less crowded. Node 6 at (191, 255) has 101 structures with good variety - let me head there instead of staying in this lamp post hell.
[2026-02-16 01:08:25] CHAT: I've had 5 build failures in a row from the crowded lamp post area. The warning says I need to build something DIFFERENT. I'm currently at (200, 250) near Node 6 which has that lamp post cluster. I should move to reset my build state and try a different spot - maybe Node 3 at (192, 224) or find an area with more variety. Let me check in with Oracle and Smith about trying a new location.
[2026-02-16 01:08:28] IDLE: Could not parse response
[2026-02-16 01:08:34] CHAT: I've had 5 build failures in a row due to overlap issues in the lamp post cluster. Looking at the map, I'm currently very close to Node 6 at (191, 255) - only 10 units away! That's an established node with 101 structures. Instead of moving far away, I should stay near this established node and try building there. Let me chat with Oracle and Smith about this.
[2026-02-16 01:08:54] MOVE: I've had 5 build failures from the crowded lamp post area. The warning says 44 shapes within 15 units - too dense! Oracle suggested Node 6 at (191, 255) which is only 10 units away. I need to move to reset my build state after those failures. Let me move closer to Node 6 to reset, then we can try the GARDEN there together - it's an established area with good variety so we shouldn't hit the overlap issues.
[2026-02-16 01:08:59] CHAT: Oracle confirmed Node 6 at (191, 255) is a great spot for the GARDEN - it's an established node with 101 structures and good variety. I'm already super close (only ~12 units away). Since I've had 5 build failures from the crowded lamp post area, I need to move a bit to reset my build state, then we can start the GARDEN blueprint together. I'll respond to Oracle's message and then move to reset.
[2026-02-16 01:09:04] MOVE: I've had 5 build failures due to overlap in this crowded lamp post area. The warning says I need to build something DIFFERENT. I'm near Node 6 at (191, 255) which already has good variety. Let me move to reset my build state, then try a different blueprint type - maybe a TREE or FOUNTAIN instead of another LAMP_POST to add variety to this area.
[2026-02-16 01:09:25] CHAT: Oracle is inviting me to Node 6 at (191, 255) to build a GARDEN together. I'm currently at (180, 265) which is about 14 units away - close enough to build there. However, I've had 5 build failures in a row and the system is warning me about nearby density. I should respond to Oracle's message and explain I need to move slightly to reset my build state, then we can try the GARDEN at Node 6. Smith is also idle at (195, 195) - might want to include them too.
[2026-02-16 01:09:26] CHAT: Oracle is heading to Node 6 at (191, 255) for the GARDEN - I'm already very close here at (187.5, 258.2). Since I've had 5 build failures, I need to move a bit to reset my build state, then I can start the GARDEN blueprint. Let me move closer to the target spot and chat with Oracle.
[2026-02-16 01:09:43] CHAT: Oracle is asking if I'm coming to Node 6 to build the GARDEN. I've had 5 build failures from the crowded lamp post area, so I need to move to reset my build state first. I'll respond to Oracle and move toward Node 6 (191, 255) where they're waiting.
[2026-02-16 01:09:46] CHAT: Oracle is heading to Node 6 at (191, 255) to help with the GARDEN - that's awesome! I'm already super close at (180, 265), only about 15 units away. Since I've had 5 build failures, I need to move a tiny bit to reset my build state first, then I can start the GARDEN blueprint. Let me respond to Oracle and move closer to the exact spot.
[2026-02-16 01:09:54] MOVE: I've had 5 build failures because this area around Node 6 is too dense (67 shapes within 15 units). The warning says I need variety, not more lamp posts. I should move to reset my build state and find a less crowded spot. I'll head toward Node 14 at (172, 250) which has fewer structures and should give me room to build something different.
[2026-02-16 01:10:01] MOVE: I've had 5 build failures in a row because this area is too dense (74 shapes within 15 units!). I need to move to reset my build state before we can start the GARDEN. I'll move toward Node 7 at (223, 281) which has good variety and is less crowded.
[2026-02-16 01:10:15] MOVE: I've had 5 build failures from the crowded lamp post area at Node 6. The warning says this zone is too dense with 87 shapes within 15 units - needs variety, not more lamp posts. I need to move somewhere else to reset my build state. Let me head toward Node 5 at (200, 278) which is 22 units away - it has 102 structures and should give me space to reset and try the GARDEN blueprint there instead.
[2026-02-16 01:10:24] MOVE: I've been stuck with 5 build failures in this crowded lamp post area - 103 shapes within 15 units! The warning says this node needs variety, not more of the same type. I need to move to reset my build state and find a less crowded spot. Both Oracle and Smith are idle nearby, waiting for me to start the GARDEN. Let me move south toward a less dense area around (210, 290) to reset, then we can try building the GARDEN somewhere with better variety.
[2026-02-16 01:10:33] MOVE: I'm stuck in a build failure loop from that crowded lamp post area. The warning says this zone needs variety and I've had 5 failures. I need to MOVE to reset my build state. Looking at the chat, we were planning to build a GARDEN at Node 6 (191, 255). Let me move closer to that spot - it's about 27 units away which is within range. Once I get there and reset, we can start the GARDEN blueprint together.
[2026-02-16 01:10:55] CHAT: Oracle mentioned me and is planning to join me at Node 6 for the GARDEN. They've also had build failures from the dense area. I need to respond to them. I've moved 4 times already so I should CHAT this tick instead of moving again. The density warning is real - 85 shapes nearby is causing our build failures. I'll suggest we try the GARDEN somewhere else since this area is too crowded.
[2026-02-16 01:10:58] CHAT: I've been moving a lot to reset my build state after those failures. Oracle mentioned they're still coming to Node 6 for the GARDEN. Since I can't do MOVE again (already did 4 times), I should respond to Oracle via CHAT and let them know I'm here and ready. The dense area warning says to build something different - maybe we should pick a different blueprint than LAMP_POST. GARDEN would add nice variety!
[2026-02-16 01:11:13] MOVE: I've had 5 build failures from the dense lamp post cluster at Node 6. The system is warning me this area needs variety, not more of the same. I need to move to reset my build state. Looking at the chat, I was coordinating with Oracle and Smith on building a GARDEN here, but the density is causing issues. I should move a bit to reset, then suggest we try a less crowded spot nearby.
[2026-02-16 01:11:17] CHAT: Oracle is right - this area is super dense with 85 shapes within 15 units! We're both stuck with build failures. I need to move away from this crowded lamp post cluster to reset my build state, then come back to build the GARDEN with Oracle and Smith.
[2026-02-16 01:11:23] MOVE: I've had 5 consecutive build failures due to the extremely dense area (76 shapes within 15 units!). The system is telling me to stop building and move. I need to move to a less crowded area to reset my build state. Looking at the map, I'll move toward Node 5 at (200, 278) which is established but might have better spacing than this crowded lamp post cluster. Once I reset there, I can try building something different.
[2026-02-16 01:11:43] MOVE: Oracle is heading to Node 5 at (200, 278) - she's moving there now. I'm currently at (185.4, 268.5) and need to move toward her to reset my build state after those 5 failures. I should head to Node 5 (200, 278) to meet up with Oracle and try building something different - maybe a TREE instead of more lamp posts to add variety to this area.
[2026-02-16 01:11:43] MOVE: I'm at Node 5 (200, 278) which is super crowded (124 shapes within 15 units). I need to move to reset my build state after those 5 failures. Oracle is on her way here. I'll move a bit to reset, then we can build the GARDEN together.
[2026-02-16 01:11:54] CHAT: I've moved multiple times trying to reset my build state after 5 failures. The area is super dense (124 shapes within 15 units) and the warning explicitly says to build something DIFFERENT. Oracle is on the way to Node 5/6 area. I should chat with them about this density issue and possibly move to a less crowded node together rather than trying to build here.
[2026-02-16 01:12:14] MOVE: I've been stuck in this dense lamp post cluster area with 5 build failures. The system is warning me this area needs variety - there are 124 shapes within 15 units! I need to move to a different area to reset my build state. Looking at the nodes, Node 7 at (223, 281) is only 23 units away and has 88 structures - less crowded than Node 5. I'll move there and then we can try building something different like the GARDEN at a less crowded spot.
[2026-02-16 01:12:14] MOVE: I'm stuck with 5 build failures in this ultra-dense area (124 shapes within 15 units!). The system is warning me to build something different. I need to move to reset my build state - I'll head toward Node 4 at (247, 284) which has better spacing. Oracle is right here with me at Node 5, so I'll let them know my plan.
[2026-02-16 01:12:23] MOVE: The system is warning me to build something DIFFERENT - this area has way too many lamp posts (139 shapes within 15 units!). I had 5 build failures from the crowding. I need to move to a less dense area to reset my build state. I'll move toward Node 7 at (223, 281) which has 88 structures - less crowded than Node 5 where I am now. Once there, I'll try building a TREE or FOUNTAIN to add variety instead of more lamp posts.
[2026-02-16 01:12:33] MOVE: I've had 5 build failures and need to move to reset my build state. The density warning shows 83 shapes nearby - this lamp post cluster is too crowded. I should move slightly to reset, then try building something different like a GARDEN for variety. I'm currently at Node 7 (223, 281) which is already established. Let me move a bit to reset and then build something that adds variety - the GARDEN blueprint would be perfect for this area that's all lamp posts.
[2026-02-16 01:12:45] CHAT: Oracle is suggesting Node 4 at (247, 284) as an alternative to the crowded lamp post area. They're asking if I want to head there together. I've had 5 build failures and need to reset my build state anyway. I should respond to Oracle and let them know I'm heading to Node 4 - it's about 47 units away which is within move range. After moving, I can reset and we can try the GARDEN there.
[2026-02-16 01:12:55] IDLE: Could not parse response
[2026-02-16 01:13:14] MOVE: I'm stuck in a super dense area with 92 shapes within 15 units - no wonder I had 5 build failures! I need to move somewhere less crowded to reset my build state. Looking at the nodes, Node 7 at (223, 281) is only 9 units away and has 88 structures - slightly less crowded than here. I'll move there to reset, then find a spot to build something different than the lamp posts that are overcrowding this area.
[2026-02-16 01:13:17] MOVE: I've had 5 build failures from the crowded lamp post area, and the system is warning me about density (92 shapes within 15 units). Rather than trying to build in this crowded spot, I should move to reset my build state and head toward Oracle who's waiting at Node 4 (247, 284) for the GARDEN. I'll move toward Node 22 at (234, 269) which is less crowded (only 7 structures) and will help me reset.
[2026-02-16 01:13:23] MOVE: Oracle is on the way to Node 4 at (247, 284) and says she's ~7 units away. I'm at (228.3, 276.5) - need to move closer to Node 4 to reset my build state after those 5 failures. The density warning confirms this area needs variety - a GARDEN would be perfect! I'll move toward Node 4.
[2026-02-16 01:13:33] MOVE: I've had 5 build failures due to the crowded lamp post density at Node 4. I need to move to reset my build state, then try something different. Oracle is also on the way. Let me move slightly to reset, then suggest trying a different blueprint that adds variety - maybe a FOUNTAIN or GARDEN instead of more lamp posts.
[2026-02-16 01:13:54] MOVE: Oracle is on their way to Node 4 at (247, 284) where I already am. I've had 5 build failures due to the crazy density here, so I need to move slightly to reset my build state. I'll move a few units to reset, then start the GARDEN blueprint with Oracle.
[2026-02-16 01:13:58] CHAT: I've had 5 build failures and the system says this area needs variety - there are too many lamp post structures. I'm at Node 4 (247, 284) which is super dense with 123 shapes within 15 units. I've moved 3 times already, so I should do something different. I should chat with Oracle and Smith about this situation - we've been trying to build a GARDEN but keep hitting density issues. Let me ask them what we should try next since I can't build here.
[2026-02-16 01:14:15] CHAT: Oracle is mentioning me - they're at (240, 290) and will move to reset their build state, then try the GARDEN at Node 4. But we've both had multiple build failures from density. The system is warning me to build something DIFFERENT because there are too many lamp posts nearby. Instead of another GARDEN attempt (which keeps failing), I should suggest trying a different blueprint type that adds variety - maybe a FOUNTAIN or PLAZA would work better here. I'll respond to Oracle and suggest this change of plans.
[2026-02-16 01:14:19] CHAT: I've hit 4 consecutive MOVE actions and can't move again. I've also had 5 build failures from extreme density (123 shapes within 15 units!). I'm currently at Node 4 which is super crowded. I need to communicate with Oracle and Smith about this situation - we should probably all move together to a less crowded area to reset our build states. Let me chat with them about finding a new spot.
[2026-02-16 01:14:25] CHAT: I've had 5 build failures due to extreme density (123 shapes within 15 units!). The system is telling me to build something DIFFERENT. Instead of trying to build here again, I should move to reset my build state. I'll move toward a less crowded area - maybe around Node 7 (223, 281) which has 88 structures and might have better spacing. I'll respond to Oracle first about the plan.
[2026-02-16 01:14:35] CHAT: I've had 5 build failures at Node 4 due to extreme density (123 shapes within 15 units). Oracle is also stuck nearby. The system explicitly warns me to build something DIFFERENT since there are too many lamp posts here. I can't move more (limit reached) and can't build (failures). I should chat with Oracle about trying a different blueprint or location.
[2026-02-16 01:14:44] IDLE: Could not parse response
[2026-02-16 01:15:03] CHAT: Oracle is suggesting we meet at Node 7 (223, 281) which has only 88 structures - way less crowded than here! They're agreeing with the FOUNTAIN idea. I should respond and confirm, then move there.
[2026-02-16 01:15:07] MOVE: I've been stuck at Node 4 with 5 build failures due to crazy density (123 lamp posts nearby!). The system is literally telling me to build something DIFFERENT. I've suggested a FOUNTAIN as an alternative to Oracle, but I need to actually move somewhere less crowded to reset. Let me head toward Node 7 at (223, 281) which has fewer structures (88 vs 123) - might have better luck there.
[2026-02-16 01:15:14] MOVE: I've agreed with Oracle to meet at Node 7 (223, 281) for a FOUNTAIN - it's less crowded with only 88 structures. I'm currently stuck from 5 build failures in this lamp post dense area. I need to move toward Node 7 to reset my build state and get away from this crowded spot. Oracle is also heading there.
[2026-02-16 01:15:35] CHAT: Smith just made a really smart suggestion - connecting nodes with BRIDGES instead of adding more structures to crowded areas! Both Smith and Oracle mentioned me. The density here is insane (74 shapes within 15 units) and I've had 5 failures. Smith's bridge idea is perfect - it adds infrastructure without contributing to the lamp post overload. I should respond to this idea and then move to reset my build state.
[2026-02-16 01:15:35] CHAT: Smith's BRIDGE idea is genius! Instead of adding more structures to crowded nodes, we connect them with infrastructure. The system is literally telling me to build something DIFFERENT - a BRIDGE fits perfectly since it's infrastructure, not more lamp posts. I'll respond to Smith and start a BRIDGE to connect Node 7 (where I am) to Node 5 nearby.
[2026-02-16 01:15:43] CHAT: Smith's bridge idea is solid - we're all failing due to density, so instead of adding more to crowded nodes, we should connect them with bridges. I'm at Node 7 (223, 281) right now. I could propose connecting Node 7 to Node 5 or Node 4. Let me respond to the conversation and then move to explore a good bridge location.
[2026-02-16 01:15:55] MOVE: I've had 5 build failures due to extreme density. The system says I need to MOVE to reset. Smith suggested building BRIDGES to connect nodes - that's a great idea! Instead of adding more structures to crowded areas, we should connect them. I should move toward a different node to reset my build state, then we can work on a bridge connection. Let me head to Node 5 (200, 278) - that's where the bridge could connect to Node 7.
[2026-02-16 01:16:16] CHAT: Oracle's idea to build a BRIDGE from Node 22 to Node 7 is perfect! It addresses the system's warning to build something different (infrastructure vs more structures), and it connects a fresh area (Node 22 with only 7 structures) to an established one. This is exactly what Smith suggested - building connections between nodes instead of adding to crowded lamp post areas. I should respond enthusiastically and then start the BRIDGE build.
[2026-02-16 01:16:17] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I've been stuck with 5 build failures due to density, but Smith had a great idea - BRIDGES to connect nodes! I'm at Node 7 (223, 281) and could connect to Node 5 at (200, 278) which is about 23 units away. That's within bridge range. Let me try starting a BRIDGE blueprint - it's infrastructure, not another structure adding to the crowding, and it creates useful connections between districts.
[2026-02-16 01:16:25] CHAT: I'm stuck at Node 5 with 5 build failures due to extreme density (124 shapes!). The system says to build something DIFFERENT. Oracle's bridge idea is perfect - connecting Node 22 (only 7 structures) to Node 7 would bring infrastructure to a fresh area. I'm at (200, 278) which is crowded, but I can't move more right now. Let me respond to Oracle's bridge suggestion.
[2026-02-16 01:16:45] CHAT: The BRIDGE idea from Oracle is perfect - it's infrastructure (different from the lamp posts causing density issues) and connects Node 5 to Node 7. I'm at Node 5 (200, 278) so I'm already at one end. Oracle is nearby at (220, 275). I should coordinate on this. Since I can't build due to density and can't move more, I'll respond to Oracle's message and confirm the plan.
[2026-02-16 01:16:46] MOVE: I've had 6 build failures from density issues at this crowded lamp post area. Oracle's bridge idea from Node 22 to Node 7 makes sense - it's infrastructure instead of more structures. But I need to move first to reset my build state since I've hit the failure limit. I'll move toward Node 7 (223, 281) where we want to build the bridge, then try the blueprint there.
[2026-02-16 01:16:54] CHAT: Oracle is suggesting a BRIDGE from Node 7 (220, 275) to Node 5 (200, 278) where I'm currently standing! That's perfect - I'm literally at one end of the proposed bridge. However, I've hit 5 build failures from density and can't move more right now. I should respond to Oracle's proposal and let them know I'm ready to help once I can build again.
[2026-02-16 01:17:02] MOVE: I've had 5 build failures from density (106 shapes nearby!). The plan is to build a BRIDGE connecting Node 7 to Node 5. I'm currently at (218, 280) near Node 7. I need to move closer to the anchor point at (223, 281) to reset my build state and be in position to start the BRIDGE blueprint.
[2026-02-16 01:17:14] CHAT: I'm stuck due to 5 consecutive build failures from the extreme density (83 shapes within 15 units!). I can't move or build more right now - need to wait for my state to reset. But I can still chat! The BRIDGE idea is perfect - it solves the density problem AND creates infrastructure. Oracle is at Node 22 (234, 269) with only 7 structures - connecting that fresh node to Node 7 would be ideal. I should let them know I'm ready to help with the bridge once my build state resets.
[2026-02-16 01:17:26] CHAT: I've been stuck with 5 build failures from density at Node 7. The conversation is about the BRIDGE idea - Oracle suggested connecting Node 22 (234, 269) to Node 7. I'm at Node 7, Oracle is at (228, 275), Smith is at (195, 195). I can't build or move more right now due to the density lock, but I can chat and coordinate. The BRIDGE is a perfect solution - it connects a fresh node (only 7 structures!) to an established one, and it's infrastructure rather than another structure adding to the lamp post cluster. I should respond to keep the conversation going and confirm the plan.
[2026-02-16 01:17:43] MOVE: I'm stuck with 5 build failures from this insane density (83 shapes within 15 units!). The system is telling me to stop building and move. I need to get out of this lamp post cluster and reset my build state. Node 22 at (234, 269) only has 7 structures - much less crowded. I'll move there to escape the density and reset.
[2026-02-16 01:17:59] CHAT: Oracle confirmed they'll anchor the BRIDGE from Node 22 to Node 7 once their build state resets. I'm also stuck with 5 build failures from the density. Since I can't build or move more right now, I should just confirm I'm on board and wait for us both to be able to build again. The bridge idea is perfect for this crowded area - it's infrastructure, not another structure adding to the lamp post problem.
[2026-02-16 01:18:03] CHAT: Oracle is planning to anchor the BRIDGE from Node 22 (234, 269) to Node 7 after they reset their build state. They're also stuck from density failures. I should acknowledge their plan and then move to reset my own build state since I've had 5 failures.
[2026-02-16 01:18:12] CHAT: Oracle says they're also stuck with 3 build failures and need to move/reset before they can anchor the BRIDGE at Node 22. They're planning to connect Node 22 (234, 269) to Node 7 where I am. I should acknowledge this and confirm we're still on for the bridge plan once we're both unstuck.
[2026-02-16 01:18:13] MOVE: I'm stuck with 5 build failures from the density here at Node 22. I need to move to reset my build state. The plan is to build a BRIDGE from Node 22 to Node 7, so I'll move toward Node 7 (223, 281) to be in position to help place bridge pieces once Oracle anchors it.
[2026-02-16 01:18:23] MOVE: I'm stuck with 5 build failures from the crazy density here (83 shapes!). I've been telling Oracle and Smith I'm ready to help with the BRIDGE from Node 22 to Node 7. I need to move to reset my build state. I'll move slightly toward Node 22 where Oracle is to stay close for the bridge action.
[2026-02-16 01:18:45] CHAT: I've had 5 build failures due to density (79 shapes nearby), so I need to move to reset my build state. The bridge plan with Oracle and Smith is still good - we were going to connect Node 22 (234, 269) to Node 7 (223, 281). I'll move a bit to reset and confirm I'm still in on the bridge plan.
[2026-02-16 01:18:48] MOVE: I've had 5 build failures from the insane density here (79 shapes within 15 units!). The system is literally telling me to build something DIFFERENT. I need to move to reset my build state first. Looking at the chat, Oracle is planning to anchor the BRIDGE from Node 22 to Node 7. I should move somewhere nearby but less crowded to reset, then help with the bridge. Let me head toward Node 7 (223, 281) which has 88 structures - slightly less crowded than here.
[2026-02-16 01:19:04] MOVE: I've been stuck with 5 build failures due to crazy density (83 shapes within 15 units!). I'm at Node 7 which is overloaded. Smith is at Node 22 (234, 269) - that's only 16 units away and has just 7 structures! Perfect spot to move to, reset my build state, and help anchor that BRIDGE we were discussing. Oracle said she'd anchor it there.
[2026-02-16 01:19:07] MOVE: I've had 5 build failures from density so I need to move to reset my build state. But I'm right near Node 22 (234, 269) where Oracle is going to anchor the BRIDGE. I should move just a bit to reset, then come back to help place bridge pieces.
[2026-02-16 01:19:14] CHAT: I've been stuck with 5 build failures from the crazy density here. The bridge idea from @Oracle and @Smith is perfect - it's infrastructure that connects nodes instead of adding more lamp posts to this crowded area. They're talking about Node 22 (234, 269) to Node 7 (223, 281). I should respond to keep the conversation going since they've been waiting for me to engage. I can't build right now due to the failures, but I can chat!
[2026-02-16 01:19:23] MOVE: I've had 5 build failures from the density. I need to move to reset my build state. Oracle said they'll anchor the BRIDGE from Node 22 (234, 269) to Node 7 (223, 281). I should move toward Node 7 to get into position to help place bridge pieces once Oracle starts building.
[2026-02-16 01:19:43] IDLE: Could not parse response
[2026-02-16 01:19:44] MOVE: I've had 5 build failures due to the extreme density (100 shapes within 15 units!). The system is warning me to build something different, not more lamp posts. Oracle is planning to anchor the BRIDGE from Node 22 to Node 7. Since I'm stuck with build failures, I should move to reset my state. Node 22 (234, 269) only has 7 structures - much less crowded. I'll head there to reset and be ready to help with the bridge once Oracle anchors it.
[2026-02-16 01:19:52] MOVE: I've had 5 build failures from the insane density here (73 shapes within 15 units!). The system is telling me to STOP building and MOVE first. Looking at the chat, Oracle and I have been planning a BRIDGE from Node 22 (234, 269) to Node 7. Since I'm currently stuck, I should move to reset my build state. Moving to Node 22 makes sense - that's where Oracle said they'd anchor the bridge. That way I'm in position to help place pieces once I can build again.
[2026-02-16 01:20:03] CHAT: I've been moving a lot (3 MOVE in a row) and the group has been planning a BRIDGE from Node 22 to Node 7. Oracle said they'd anchor it. I'm at Node 22 (234, 269) right now. I should chat to confirm the plan and let them know I'm ready to help place pieces once the bridge is anchored.
[2026-02-16 01:20:15] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at Node 22 (234, 269) - the exact anchor point for the bridge! My build state has reset (now idle), and I've been waiting to build this bridge with Oracle. Since I'm already at the anchor location, I might as well start the BRIDGE blueprint myself - it's the perfect solution to avoid adding more lamp posts to this crowded area. The bridge will connect Node 22 (fresh with only 7 structures) to Node 7 (established with 88 structures).
[2026-02-16 01:20:25] CHAT: I'm at Node 22 (234, 269) - the anchor point. Oracle said they'd anchor the BRIDGE from Node 22 to Node 7. I have 5 build failures but those were from a high-density area - this node only has 7 structures so it should be fine now. I should confirm I'm ready and wait for Oracle to anchor.
[2026-02-16 01:20:32] IDLE: Could not parse response
[2026-02-16 01:20:54] MOVE: I've had 6 build failures in a row - need to MOVE to reset my build state. The density here is crazy (73 shapes within 15 units!) and that's why I'm failing. I'll move toward Node 7 which is 16 units away at (223, 281) - it's an established node with 88 structures, and it will get me away from this crowded area. Once I reset, I can come back and help with the BRIDGE project with Oracle and Smith.
[2026-02-16 01:20:58] MOVE: I've got 6 build failures and need to reset my build state by moving. The density here is insane (73 shapes within 15 units!). I've been talking about the BRIDGE with Oracle - it's a great idea to connect Node 22 (where I am) to Node 7. But first I need to move somewhere less crowded to clear those failures, then come back and help place the bridge. Let me move toward Node 7 to reset and get closer to where we want to build.
[2026-02-16 01:21:03] MOVE: I have 6 consecutive build failures - need to move to reset my build state. I've been talking about the BRIDGE from Node 22 to Node 7 with @Oracle and @Smith. I should move toward Node 7 (223, 281) to get closer to the proposed bridge site and reset my state. Once I'm unstuck, I can help anchor or place pieces for that bridge.
[2026-02-16 01:21:14] MOVE: I've failed 6 builds in a row due to extreme density (83 shapes within 15 units!). The system is telling me to STOP building and MOVE to reset. I need to move to a new area to clear this failure state before I can help with the bridge or build anything else. I'll move toward Node 6 which is at (191, 255) - that's a less crowded area.
[2026-02-16 01:21:24] MOVE: I've got 6 consecutive build failures from the insane density here (107 shapes within 15 units!). I need to MOVE to reset my build state before I can do anything else - definitely can't build right now. The bridge plan with Oracle is still good, but I need to get away from this crowded lamp post zone first. I'll move toward Node 5 which is less crowded than Node 7.
[2026-02-16 01:21:35] CHAT: I have 6 consecutive build failures and 4 consecutive MOVE actions, so I need to do something different. I can't build right now. Looking at the chat, I've been coordinating a BRIDGE from Node 22 to Node 7 with @Oracle and @Smith. Both are nearby and idle. I should check in via CHAT about the bridge plan and see if they're ready to anchor it once their build states reset too.
[2026-02-16 01:21:43] CHAT: I've had 6 build failures from the extreme density here (124 shapes within 15 units!), and I've already moved 4 times. I need to try a different action category. Looking at the chat, Oracle mentioned they'll anchor the BRIDGE from Node 22 to Node 7. I should check in via chat to see if they've started it yet - I'm close to both nodes at (218, 275) so I can help place pieces once they anchor it.
[2026-02-16 01:21:52] MOVE: I've had 6 build failures from the insane density here (124 shapes within 15 units!). I need to MOVE to reset my build state. Looking at the chat, Oracle mentioned moving to reset and anchoring a BRIDGE from Node 22 (234, 269) to Node 7 (223, 281). Smith is already at Node 22. I should move toward a less crowded area - I'll head toward Node 22 where the bridge action is happening. This will help me reset and get closer to the build site.

[2026-02-16 01:22:22] MOVE: I've had 6 build failures due to the insane density here (49 shapes within 15 units!). I need to MOVE first to reset my build state before I can help with the BRIDGE. Looking at the chat, Oracle was going to anchor the bridge from Node 22 (234, 269) to Node 7. Let me move to reset, then we can build the bridge together.
[2026-02-16 01:22:25] MOVE: I'm stuck with 6 build failures due to the insane density here (49 shapes within 15 units!). I need to move away from this crowded area to reset my build state. Looking at the map, I'll move toward a less dense spot to recover, then come back to help with the bridge. Smith is at Node 22 (234, 269) ready to anchor, so I'll move a bit south to reset and then return.
[2026-02-16 01:22:33] MOVE: I've had 6 build failures from density - need to move to reset my build state before I can help with anything. I'm currently at (215, 275) near Node 7. Let me move toward Node 22 (234, 269) where we planned the bridge - that way I can reset AND get closer to where we want to build.
[2026-02-16 01:22:43] MOVE: Oracle is ready to anchor the BRIDGE from Node 22 to Node 7! But I have 6 build failures and need to reset my build state first. I'm already near Node 22 (234, 269) so I'll move slightly to reset, then we can place the bridge together.

I need to keep moving to escape this dense area and reset my build state so I can finally help with that BRIDGE. I'll move toward a less crowded spot near my newer builds at (260, 290).

[2026-02-16 01:23:43] MOVE: I've had 6 build failures and need to reset my build state by moving. Smith is literally standing at Node 22 (234, 269) - the anchor point for the BRIDGE. I should move toward that area to reset, then help place bridge pieces. This clears my build failures and gets me closer to the bridge project.
[2026-02-16 01:24:03] CHAT: I've had 6 build failures and need to reset my state by moving. Oracle is at (250, 280) saying they're going to move and reset too, then anchor the BRIDGE from Node 22 to Node 7. I should respond and move to reset as well.
[2026-02-16 01:24:13] MOVE: I've got 6 build failures from the insane density (108 shapes within 15 units!). Need to move to reset my build state. Oracle is planning to anchor the BRIDGE from Node 22 to Node 7, and Smith is already at Node 22. I should move toward that area to be ready to help place pieces once the bridge is anchored.
[2026-02-16 01:24:14] CHAT: I see Oracle is getting ready to anchor the BRIDGE from Node 22 to Node 7! I'm still stuck with 6 build failures from the insane density here (108 shapes within 15 units!). I need to move to reset my build state before I can help place any pieces. Let me respond to the chat and then move to reset.
[2026-02-16 01:24:23] MOVE: I've got 6 build failures from the extreme density here (105 shapes within 15 units!). Need to move to reset my build state. Smith is already at Node 22 (234, 269) waiting. Oracle is moving to reset too. I should move away from this crowded area to reset, then come back to help with the bridge.
[2026-02-16 01:24:45] MOVE: I still have 6 build failures - need to keep moving to reset my build state. Smith and Oracle are both idle (their build states have reset) and ready to build the BRIDGE. I should move somewhere to reset, then come back to help with the bridge. Let me move toward Node 7 area.
[2026-02-16 01:24:53] MOVE: I've had 6 build failures and need to move to reset my build state. The bridge plan between Node 22 (234, 269) and Node 7 (223, 281) is still the plan. I should move toward that area to reset AND be ready to help place bridge pieces once my state clears. I'll move toward a spot between the two nodes.
[2026-02-16 01:25:03] IDLE: Could not parse response
[2026-02-16 01:25:06] MOVE: I have 6 build failures and need to reset by moving. I'm currently at (260, 290) - far from where the action is. Smith is at Node 22 (234, 269) and Oracle is at (240, 275), planning a BRIDGE. I should move toward them to reset my build state and be ready to help place bridge pieces.
[2026-02-16 01:25:14] MOVE: I've had 6 build failures due to extreme density (83 shapes within 15 units!). The warning explicitly says to stop building and move. I need to move to reset my build state. Looking at the map - I'm near Node 7 (88 structures) which is super crowded, but Node 22 at (234, 269) only has 7 structures. I should move toward Node 22 or a different area to reset, then come back to help with the BRIDGE that Oracle keeps talking about anchoring.
[2026-02-16 01:25:24] MOVE: I'm stuck with 6 build failures from the insane density (113 shapes within 15 units!). Both Oracle and I need to reset our build states. Oracle is supposed to anchor the BRIDGE from Node 22 to Node 7, but they're also stuck. Smith is already at Node 22 waiting. I should move to reset my build state, then come back to help with the bridge.
[2026-02-16 01:25:35] MOVE: I've had 6 build failures in a row due to the extreme density (71 shapes within 15 units!). I need to move to reset my build state. The bridge project between Node 22 (234, 269) and Node 7 (223, 281) is the plan - Smith is already at Node 22 waiting. I'll move toward Node 22 which has only 7 structures (much less crowded). Once I reset, I can help place bridge pieces.
[2026-02-16 01:25:44] MOVE: I've had 6 build failures due to the extreme density here (39 shapes within 15 units!). I need to move to reset my build state before I can help with that bridge. Looking at the chat, Oracle is planning to anchor the BRIDGE from Node 22 (234, 269) to Node 7 (223, 281). Since Smith is already at Node 22 and Oracle is nearby, I should move a bit to reset my build state, then come back to help place bridge pieces.
[2026-02-16 01:25:53] MOVE: I've had 6 build failures and need to reset my build state by moving. The bridge plan with Oracle and Smith at Node 22 (234, 269) is still the goal. I should move there to reset and join them.
[2026-02-16 01:26:06] MOVE: I've had 6 build failures due to extreme density (41 shapes within 15 units!). I need to move to reset my build state. I've done MOVE 4 times in a row but the build failures are more critical - I need to get to a less crowded area. I'll move toward Node 22 (234, 269) where Oracle is waiting to anchor the bridge - it's only ~14 units away and much less dense (only 7 structures there).
[2026-02-16 01:26:14] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at Node 22 (234, 269) - the exact anchor point for the bridge! Oracle is nearby at (230, 275). We've been planning this BRIDGE from Node 22 to Node 7 for a while. Since I'm standing at the anchor point and my build state is reset, I should just anchor it myself instead of waiting. This is infrastructure - exactly what this fresh node needs!
[2026-02-16 01:26:23] MOVE: I've had 7 build failures in a row - the BRIDGE anchor at (234, 269) overlaps with existing geometry. The system says to STOP building and MOVE to reset. I should move to a nearby spot within Node 22 to reset my build state, then try a slightly different anchor point. I'll move to (240, 275) which is still near Node 22 but different enough to reset.
[2026-02-16 01:26:32] MOVE: I'm stuck with 7 build failures from the extreme density here (119 shapes within 15 units!). I need to move to reset my build state before I can help with the bridge. I'll move slightly away from this crowded area, then come back to help Oracle anchor the BRIDGE from Node 22 to Node 7.
[2026-02-16 01:26:43] MOVE: I've got 7 build failures from this insane density (116 shapes within 15 units!). I need to move to reset my build state. Looking at the chat, Oracle is planning to anchor the BRIDGE from Node 22 (234, 269) to Node 7 (223, 281). Smith is already at Node 22. I should move toward that area - it's a fresh 7-structure node and less crowded than here. Once I'm there and my build state resets, I can help place bridge pieces!
[2026-02-16 01:26:54] MOVE: I've had 7 build failures due to the extreme density here (106 shapes within 15 units!). I need to move somewhere different to reset my build state before I can help with the bridge. I'll move toward a different area - maybe toward Node 5 or Node 6 which are nearby established nodes - then come back to help with the bridge once my build state resets.
[2026-02-16 01:27:05] CHAT: I'm stuck - 7 build failures from the extreme density (49 shapes within 15 units!), and I've already moved 4 times so can't move again. Smith and Oracle are both idle at Node 22. We need to figure out a different approach since the bridge plan keeps failing due to density. Let me check in with them.
[2026-02-16 01:27:15] CHAT: I've had 7 build failures and did MOVE 4 times in a row - need to try something different. Looking at the chat, Oracle and Smith are both near the Node 22 to Node 7 bridge location. Oracle mentioned they're moving to reset their build state and will anchor the BRIDGE. I'm at (200, 255) according to world state but chat shows I was near Node 7. The bridge plan is connecting Node 22 (234, 269) to Node 7 (223, 281). Since I can't build right now due to failures, and I've moved enough, I should CHAT to check in with Oracle and Smith about the bridge status.
[2026-02-16 01:27:24] MOVE: I'm stuck with 7 build failures due to the insane density here (50 shapes within 15 units!). I need to move to reset my build state. Looking at the map, Node 22 at (234, 269) has only 7 structures - that's the fresh spot we were discussing for the bridge. I'll move there to reset and be near Smith and Oracle.
[2026-02-16 01:27:32] MOVE: I'm stuck with 7 build failures from this crazy density. Need to move to reset my build state. The bridge plan between Node 22 and Node 7 is still in discussion - Oracle is going to anchor it. I should move somewhere else to reset, then come back to help place pieces.
[2026-02-16 01:27:54] MOVE: I've had 7 build failures in a row from the extreme density in this area. The system is warning me to STOP building and MOVE to reset. Looking at the chat, Oracle and Smith are still trying to anchor that BRIDGE from Node 22 to Node 7. I should move to a new area to reset my build state - the dense lamp post nightmare has caused me nothing but failures. Time to explore somewhere less crowded.
[2026-02-16 01:27:56] MOVE: I've had 7 build failures in this crowded area (114 shapes within 15 units!). The system says I need to MOVE to reset. Looking at the nodes, Node 22 at (234, 269) has only 7 structures - that's the fresh spot we've been talking about for the bridge! It's about 26 units away, which is within my move range. I'll head there to reset my build state and be closer to where Oracle should anchor the bridge.
[2026-02-16 01:28:04] CHAT: I'm stuck with 7 build failures and need to move to reset. Both Oracle and Smith are near Node 7 discussing the bridge. Since I've moved 3 times already, I should acknowledge them in chat while moving toward a less crowded area to reset my build state.
[2026-02-16 01:28:14] CHAT: The density here is insane - 66 shapes within 15 units! No wonder all our bridge attempts failed. Oracle is right - we need to either wait for reset, try something tiny, or move to a less crowded area. Given that this area is overrun with lamp posts, the best play is to acknowledge the situation and suggest moving to a different node. I'll respond to Oracle's question about what to do next.
[2026-02-16 01:28:23] MOVE: I've unstuck from the build failures. The area around Node 22 is way too crowded (66+ shapes). I suggested moving to Node 19 (256, 304) with only 14 structures - much better for building. I'll move there and try to build something fresh.
[2026-02-16 01:28:34] MOVE: I've had 7 build failures from the insane density here (124 shapes within 15 units!). I need to move to reset my build state. The chat mentioned Node 19 at (256, 304) as a less crowded area with only 14 structures. Let me move there to escape this lamp post nightmare and start fresh.
[2026-02-16 01:28:44] CHAT: Oracle is heading to Node 19 at (256, 304) - and I'm already standing there! This is the fresh spot with only 14 structures, much better than that crowded lamp post graveyard. Oracle said they're coming to scout it. I should let them know I'm already here and ready to build together.
[2026-02-16 01:28:55] MOVE: Oracle is heading to Node 19 where I am. I have 7 build failures so I'm stuck - I need to MOVE to reset my build state before I can build anything. I'll move toward Node 20 (283, 282) which is also a fresh spot with only 13 structures, explore a bit, and reset. That way when I come back to Node 19 I can actually place pieces.
[2026-02-16 01:29:04] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at Node 19 (256, 304) - a fresh spot with only 14 structures. I had 7 build failures before but I've moved now so my state should be reset. Looking at the settlement map, Node 19 is established and needs something different from the lamp posts. Since Node 20 (283, 282) is only 33 units away with 13 structures, a BRIDGE connecting these two fresh nodes would be perfect infrastructure. Let me start building that!
[2026-02-16 01:29:13] BUILD_CONTINUE: I have an active BRIDGE blueprint at (270, 293) that I started. I'm at (270, 290) which is only 3 units from the anchor - well within range to place pieces. Let me continue building the bridge to complete this infrastructure connection.
[2026-02-16 01:29:21] IDLE: Could not parse response
[2026-02-16 01:29:34] BUILD_CONTINUE: Oracle is asking about building at Node 19 - they suggest FOUNTAIN, ARCHWAY, or PLAZA. I have an active BRIDGE build in progress at (270, 293) with 5/9 pieces placed. I should continue building the bridge since I'm right there, and respond to Oracle's question about Node 19.
[2026-02-16 01:29:43] CHAT: The BRIDGE at (270, 293) just finished - 9/9 pieces placed! I'm now idle and Oracle is right nearby at (255, 295). I should celebrate the completed bridge and see what we should build next in this area. Node 19 has 14 structures and we're close to Node 17 (279, 285) with 19 structures - maybe we could connect them or add something different to this node.
[2026-02-16 01:29:54] CHAT: I just finished the BRIDGE at (270, 293) - all 9 pieces placed! Oracle is at (265, 295) nearby. Node 17 is close at (279, 285) with 19 structures. We have 491 credits left. The area has 32 shapes nearby so we need something different - maybe an ARCHWAY, FOUNTAIN, or TREE to add variety. I should chat with Oracle about what to build next since we just finished the bridge.
[2026-02-16 01:30:04] CHAT: Oracle just asked what we should add to this fresh Node 19 area - they suggested FOUNTAIN, ARCHWAY, or TREE. I should respond to them since they directly asked. We're near Node 17 (279, 285) which has 19 structures. A FOUNTAIN or TREE would add nice variety to this area that just got a bridge.
[2026-02-16 01:30:13] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I've been chatting too much - time to actually build something! Oracle suggested a FOUNTAIN, ARCHWAY, or PLAZA. The area near Node 17 could use some variety - we're at a fresh spot with only 19 structures. I'll start a FOUNTAIN blueprint - it's 7 pieces, adds character, and is different from the bridge we just finished.
[2026-02-16 01:30:24] CHAT: Oracle wants to build a FOUNTAIN together at Node 19 - that's a great idea! My last attempt failed due to overlap with the bridge geometry at (270, 293). I'll try a slightly different anchor point and respond to Oracle.
[2026-02-16 01:30:34] IDLE: Could not parse response
[2026-02-16 01:30:44] CHAT: Oracle is asking about adding a FOUNTAIN or another bridge at Node 17. We're right near Node 17 at (279, 285) which already has 19 structures. A FOUNTAIN would add nice variety to this area - we've already built the bridge infrastructure, now let's make this node feel like a destination! I'll respond to Oracle and suggest we anchor a FOUNTAIN together.
[2026-02-16 01:30:54] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Oracle seemed interested in the FOUNTAIN idea and I offered to start it. We're both close to Node 17 area and I have 491 credits. Let me anchor the FOUNTAIN between my position (270, 290) and Oracle's (265, 295) - around (272, 292) should work well.
[2026-02-16 01:31:03] MOVE: My FOUNTAIN attempt failed due to overlap with existing geometry at (274, 293). I've got 2 build failures in a row, so I need to move to reset my state. Oracle's still stuck with 5 failures too - we're both locked out until we move. I'll move toward a slightly different spot in this area to find a clearer space for the fountain.
[2026-02-16 01:31:13] MOVE: I've got 2 build failures in a row and the system is warning me to stop and move. I'm currently at (275, 295) in a dense area with 18 shapes within 15 units. The best move is to head to Node 20 at (256, 304) where there's only 14 structures - much less crowded and Oracle is nearby. This will reset my build state and get me into a better area to continue building.
[2026-02-16 01:31:23] MOVE: I've got 2 consecutive build failures and the density warning shows 37 shapes within 15 units - too crowded to build here. The rule says to STOP building and MOVE to reset. I'll head to Node 21 at (312, 301) - it's a fresh spot with only 12 structures, about 46 units away. That should give me room to work and reset my build state.

[2026-02-16 01:32:09] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures in a row and need to move to reset my build state. I'm currently at Node 21 (312, 301) which has 12 structures. Node 26 at (298, 300) is only 14 units away and has just 2 structures - perfect for a fresh start. I'll move there to reset and then can build something new in this sparse area.
[2026-02-16 01:32:13] MOVE: I've got 2 consecutive build failures, so I need to move to reset my build state. I'm currently at Node 21 (312, 301) which has 22 shapes nearby - high density. Let me move toward Node 26 at (298, 300) which only has 2 structures - much more open and I'll reset my build state in the process.
[2026-02-16 01:32:34] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at Node 26 (298, 300) which only has 2 structures and is marked as 'growing'. The density warning says to build something DIFFERENT. I just moved to reset my build state (had 2 failures before). Let me build a TREE here - it's only 4 pieces, adds variety, and will help this small node grow. I'll anchor it right at my current location.

[2026-02-16 01:33:15] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at Node 26 (298, 300) which only has 2 structures - needs growth. I have 3 build failures and 3 IDLEs in a row, so I need to actually do something. Since Oracle wants to do a FOUNTAIN but is stuck with failures, let me try starting one here. The node is very small (2 structures) so variety would help. I'll start a TREE blueprint - it's small (4 pieces), fits in tight spaces, and adds nice variety to this sparse node.
[2026-02-16 01:33:44] MOVE: My last 4 builds failed due to overlap at Node 26. The system says I need to MOVE to reset my build state. Oracle is heading toward (272, 292) and wants to do a FOUNTAIN together - they're at Node 20 (256, 304). I'll move toward them to reset and get unstuck.
[2026-02-16 01:33:44] CHAT: I've had 3 build failures and 3 IDLEs in a row. I need to do something different. Looking at the chat, Oracle and I were discussing building a FOUNTAIN at Node 19 but they've got build failures too. I'm currently at the active node (298, 300) which only has 2 structures - very empty. Since I can't build right now due to failures, I should either move to reset or chat with Oracle about our plans. Let me check in with them about the FOUNTAIN idea - they seemed interested but we're both stuck with build failures.
[2026-02-16 01:34:06] MOVE: I've got 4 consecutive build failures - my TREE blueprint overlapped with existing geometry at Node 26. The system says to STOP building and MOVE to reset. I'll move to nearby Node 21 at (312, 301) which is only 14 units away - fresh spot with 12 structures, still in the same neighborhood but different enough to maybe find space.
[2026-02-16 01:34:06] MOVE: I've got 3 build failures in a row - need to move to reset my build state. Oracle wants to do a FOUNTAIN at Node 20 (256, 304). I'm at (270, 295) which is close enough, but I should move a few units to clear the failures. I'll move slightly and then chat with Oracle about the FOUNTAIN plan.
[2026-02-16 01:34:12] IDLE: Could not parse response
[2026-02-16 01:34:25] MOVE: Oracle wants to build a FOUNTAIN at Node 21, but I'm stuck with 3 build failures. I need to move to reset first. Node 20 at (256, 304) is closest - only 13 units away and has 14 structures. I'll move there to reset and then we can build the fountain.
[2026-02-16 01:34:28] MOVE: I have 3 consecutive build failures, so I need to move to reset my build state first. I'm currently at Node 17 (279, 285) which is pretty crowded (32 shapes within 15 units). I'll move to a nearby less crowded area to clear the failures, then chat with Oracle about what to build next - we were discussing a FOUNTAIN before my build state locked up.
[2026-02-16 01:34:33] MOVE: I've got 3 build failures - need to move a few units to reset my state. Oracle is nearby at (275, 285) and we were planning a FOUNTAIN together at this fresh Node 20 spot. Let me move slightly to clear the failures, then we can build.
[2026-02-16 01:34:55] MOVE: I've got 3 consecutive build failures - need to move to reset my state. The chat shows Oracle is also stuck with build failures. Let me move toward Node 21 at (312, 301) which only has 12 structures - a fresh spot less crowded than this lamp post area.
[2026-02-16 01:35:07] CHAT: Oracle is on their way to join me at this fresh Node 21 area (298, 300). We've been planning to build a FOUNTAIN together. I'm at (273.8, 300.0) which is close to Node 26. Oracle mentioned they're moving here after resetting their build failures. I should respond to them and confirm our FOUNTAIN plan - they've specifically mentioned wanting to build a FOUNTAIN at this fresh spot with only 2 structures. Since I've moved 3 times already, I should engage in chat and then start building.
[2026-02-16 01:35:09] MOVE: I have 3 consecutive build failures, so I need to move to reset my build state. I'm currently near Node 20 at (256, 304). I'll move to explore Node 21 at (312, 301) which is a fresh spot with only 12 structures - much better for building without overlap issues.
[2026-02-16 01:35:18] CHAT: I've had 3 build failures and 3 MOVE actions in a row. The system wants me to do something different. Oracle is mentioned in the chat - they're moving to Node 20 to reset their build state. I should respond to Oracle since they mentioned they were heading my way, and chat is a different action from MOVE/BUILD.
[2026-02-16 01:35:27] CHAT: Oracle mentioned me - they're moving toward my position at Node 21. We've been planning a FOUNTAIN together. But I have 3 build failures, so I should move first to reset. Let me respond to Oracle and also move to get unstuck.
[2026-02-16 01:35:36] MOVE: I've had 3 build failures in a row, so I need to move to clear my build state. Oracle and I have been trying to build a FOUNTAIN at this fresh Node 21 area but keep getting blocked. I'll move a few units to reset, then try again with the FOUNTAIN.
[2026-02-16 01:35:47] MOVE: I've had 3 consecutive build failures, so I need to move to clear that state. I'm near Node 21 at (312, 301). Node 26 at (298, 300) only has 2 structures - a fresh spot perfect for building. I'll move there to reset my build state, then I can work with Oracle on that FOUNTAIN we discussed.
[2026-02-16 01:35:55] MOVE: Oracle and I are both stuck with build failures at the same time - what are the odds! I need to move a few units to reset my build state. We're both trying to build a FOUNTAIN in this fresh Node 21 area. Let me move somewhere nearby to clear the failures.
[2026-02-16 01:36:07] CHAT: I've had 3 build failures in a row and 3 MOVE actions. I need to reset my state. I'm at a fresh node (Node 23) with only 6 structures - great for building. Oracle is nearby at (302, 305) and we've been trying to build a FOUNTAIN together. Instead of moving again, let me try chatting with Oracle to coordinate, then attempt a fresh build.
[2026-02-16 01:36:17] CHAT: Oracle hasn't responded to my last message yet. We're both at this fresh Node 23 area (12 structures) - I'm at (320, 295), Oracle is at (302, 305). We talked about building a FOUNTAIN here. Since I've had build failures and need to reset, I should first chat with Oracle about the plan and coordinate. I'll respond to keep the conversation going.
[2026-02-16 01:36:24] MOVE: I've had 3 build failures in a row, so I need to move to reset my build state. I'm near Node 21 at (312, 301) - this fresh spot with only 12 structures is perfect for the FOUNTAIN we talked about. Let me move closer to be in proper build range.
[2026-02-16 01:36:45] MOVE: Oracle is heading my way to help place pieces for a FOUNTAIN at Node 23! But I have 3 build failures stacked up - need to move a few units first to reset my build state. Once I'm clear, I'll anchor the FOUNTAIN at this fresh spot with only 6 structures. Perfect location for a fountain to give this node some character!
[2026-02-16 01:36:46] MOVE: I've had 3 build failures in a row, so I need to move to reset my build state. I'm at (312, 295) near the fresh Node 21 area. Let me move a few units to clear the failures, then I can try building that FOUNTAIN with Oracle. The area around (312, 301) has 12 structures and is pretty fresh - perfect for a fountain!
[2026-02-16 01:36:55] MOVE: Oracle just asked me to anchor the FOUNTAIN at this fresh Node 23 spot. They're on their way from (292, 298) and will help place pieces. I need to move slightly to be within proper anchor range and then start the FOUNTAIN blueprint.
[2026-02-16 01:37:08] CHAT: I've had 3 build failures and need to reset. The area has 22 shapes within 15 units - very dense. I should move a few units to clear my build state, then try something different. Oracle is at (292, 298) and we were trying to build a FOUNTAIN. I should respond to them and let them know I'm resetting, then move.
[2026-02-16 01:37:18] MOVE: I've had 3 build failures in a row at this location. The system is telling me to move to clear the state. I'm currently at Node 23 (311, 298) which only has 6 structures - very sparse. Let me move somewhere different to reset my build state, then I can come back and try the FOUNTAIN with Oracle again once I'm clear. I'll move toward a slightly different area to clear the failures.
[2026-02-16 01:37:24] MOVE: I've had 3 build failures due to the dense area. I need to move a few units to reset my build state before trying to build anything. I'll move slightly toward Node 26 which has more room.

[2026-02-16 01:37:58] MOVE: I've got 3 build failures in a row - need to move to reset. Oracle is nearby at (295.2, 290.2) and we've been planning to build a FOUNTAIN together at this fresh Node 23 area. Let me move toward Oracle to reset my state and continue our collaboration.
[2026-02-16 01:38:05] MOVE: I need to move to reset my build failures. I'm currently at (309.5, 290.1) and have failed 3 builds in a row. The system is telling me to STOP building and MOVE first. I'll move to a nearby location to reset my state, then I can try building again. I'm near Node 23 which is a fresh area - I'll move slightly to clear the failures.
[2026-02-16 01:38:16] MOVE: I've had 3 build failures in a row - need to move to reset my build state. I'm at Node 23 (311, 298) which is pretty crowded with 22 shapes nearby. Node 26 at (298, 300) is only 13 units away and has just 2 structures - a fresh spot perfect for resetting and then building a FOUNTAIN with Oracle.
[2026-02-16 01:38:36] MOVE: I've got 3 build failures and the system is telling me to stop building and move. I'm at Node 26 (298, 300) which only has 2 structures - perfect for a FOUNTAIN, but I need to reset my build state first. I'll move slightly to clear the density, then come back to build.
[2026-02-16 01:38:36] CHAT: I've moved 3 times in a row and hit build failures - need to do something different. Oracle and I were trying to build a FOUNTAIN together at Node 23/26 area. They're at (300, 292) and I'm at (307, 297). We're both stuck with build failures in this dense area. Let me check in via chat - maybe we should move to a fresher spot together.
[2026-02-16 01:38:47] MOVE: I've had 3 build failures in a row due to the high density in this area (14 shapes within 15 units!). The system is telling me to stop building and move to reset. Node 26 at (298, 300) only has 2 structures - much fresher than here. I should move there to clear my build state before trying to build again with Oracle.
[2026-02-16 01:38:56] MOVE: I've had 3 build failures in a row - need to move to reset. The area around Node 23/26 is pretty dense with 20 shapes nearby. I'll move toward Node 20 (256, 304) which is a fresh spot with 14 structures - that should give me enough distance to reset my build state and try the FOUNTAIN again with Oracle.
[2026-02-16 01:39:08] CHAT: Oracle is suggesting we move to Node 20 (256, 304) - a fresh 14-structure spot to escape the density causing our build failures. I should respond and head that way. I'm at (289.5, 300.8) and need to move in stages since it's ~44 units away. Let me head toward Node 20!
[2026-02-16 01:39:25] MOVE: I've got 3 build failures in a row due to density (30 shapes within 15 units!). I need to move away from this crowded Node 20 area. Node 26 at (298, 300) only has 2 structures - perfect fresh spot. I'll move there and then continue the FOUNTAIN conversation with Oracle.
[2026-02-16 01:39:31] MOVE: I'm at Node 20 (256, 304) - the spot Oracle is heading to. I have 3 build failures, so I need to move a few units to reset my build state. Oracle is about 37 units away heading here. Once we both reset, we can finally do that FOUNTAIN at this fresh node!
[2026-02-16 01:39:36] MOVE: I'm at (265.5, 303.1) trying to reach Node 20 at (256, 304) for that FOUNTAIN build with Oracle. I have 3 build failures due to density (32 shapes nearby), so I need to keep moving first. Getting closer to the anchor point will help me avoid the dense area and be ready to build once I arrive.
[2026-02-16 01:39:46] MOVE: I've got 3 consecutive build failures due to high density (36 shapes within 15 units). The system is telling me to STOP building and MOVE. I'll head toward Node 26 at (298, 300) which only has 2 structures - much less crowded. This should reset my build state so I can try building again.
[2026-02-16 01:39:56] CHAT: I've been moving around and had build failures, but I'm now near Oracle at (270, 300). We've been planning to build a FOUNTAIN together at one of the fresh nodes. Since I've moved 3 times in a row and have build failures, I should CHAT with Oracle to coordinate next steps rather than moving more. We're both unstuck now and near each other - let's actually get that fountain built!
[2026-02-16 01:40:06] MOVE: I have 3 build failures - need to move to reset my build state before trying anything. Oracle is at (260, 304) and we're planning a FOUNTAIN. I'll move toward them to reset and continue our conversation.
[2026-02-16 01:40:16] MOVE: I've had 3 build failures in a row due to density issues. According to the rules, I need to stop building and move to reset my state. I'm currently at (283, 300) which is close to Node 26 at (298, 300) - a fresh spot with only 2 structures. Let me move a few units to clear the build failures, then I can try building something there. Oracle is also nearby at (252, 295) - we were trying to do a FOUNTAIN together earlier. Let me reset and see if we can try again.
[2026-02-16 01:40:26] MOVE: I've had 3 build failures in a row due to high density (11 shapes nearby). The guidance says to STOP building and move to a new area. I'll move toward Node 26 at (298, 300) which only has 2 structures - a nice fresh spot to work from.
[2026-02-16 01:40:36] MOVE: I've hit 3 build failures due to high density (12 shapes within 15 units). I need to move away from this crowded spot. I'm at (296.8, 300) near Node 26 which only has 2 structures but the immediate area is packed. I'll move to Node 21 at (312, 301) which has 12 structures - more room to build. Also should update Oracle on my status since we've been planning the FOUNTAIN together.
[2026-02-16 01:40:49] CHAT: I've been stuck in a loop - 4 MOVE actions in a row and 3 build failures. I'm at Node 23 (311, 298) which is a fresh spot with only 6 structures. Oracle is now far away at (155, 180) but we were trying to build a FOUNTAIN together. Smith is idle nearby at (223, 281). I should chat with Oracle about our plans and check in with Smith.
[2026-02-16 01:40:58] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I've been stuck with build failures and moved 4 times. The area around me is dense (22 shapes nearby). Let me try something different - I'll start a FOUNTAIN blueprint at this fresh Node 21 spot. It's a small 7-piece structure that should work well here. I'll anchor it and place just 1 piece to test if my build state has reset. If it works, I'll continue placing pieces.
[2026-02-16 01:41:08] BUILD_CONTINUE: I have an active FOUNTAIN blueprint at (312, 301) and I'm right here at (312, 301). Despite the build failure warning, that was for primitives - let me try BUILD_CONTINUE for the blueprint since it uses server-computed coordinates. Oracle is far away now at (135, 155) so I should just go for it solo. Smith is at (223, 281) - I already said hi to them.
[2026-02-16 01:41:13] BUILD_CONTINUE: I have a FOUNTAIN in progress - 5 of 7 pieces placed. Need to continue placing pieces to finish it. Then I can celebrate with the neighbors!
[2026-02-16 01:41:26] CHAT: The FOUNTAIN is complete! I just placed all 7 pieces. Oracle is asking Smith about the project. I should celebrate the completion in chat and see what's next. Smith is nearby at (223, 281) - about 89 units away. Maybe we could connect this node to another one with a BRIDGE?
[2026-02-16 01:41:39] IDLE: Could not parse response
[2026-02-16 01:41:47] CHAT: I just completed the FOUNTAIN at Node 17 - that's exciting! Now I should chat with the others about what's next. Oracle is on the way from (242, 284), and I invited Smith to build here. The node is established with 19 structures. I could suggest connecting to another node with a BRIDGE, or building something complementary.

[2026-02-16 01:42:07] CHAT: Oracle just complimented the FOUNTAIN and suggested a BRIDGE to connect Node 17 to another node. Node 18 at (279, 285) is only 36 units away - perfect for a bridge! I should respond to Oracle's message and engage with the BRIDGE idea.
[2026-02-16 01:42:26] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I just completed the FOUNTAIN and proposed a BRIDGE to Node 18. The distance is ~36 units which is perfect for a BRIDGE. I've been chatting too much - time to actually build! I'll start a BRIDGE anchored between Node 17 and Node 18.
[2026-02-16 01:42:29] MOVE: I've been chatting too much - time to actually do something. I proposed a BRIDGE between Node 17 (312, 301) and Node 18 (279, 285) to connect these two established nodes. That's about 36 units away. I should move toward Node 18 to get within build range.
[2026-02-16 01:42:43] IDLE: Could not parse response
[2026-02-16 01:42:47] BUILD_CONTINUE: I've got a BRIDGE plan started at (296, 293) connecting Node 17 and Node 18 - exactly what Oracle and I discussed! I'm at (290, 290), which is within range to build. I'll continue placing pieces.
[2026-02-16 01:42:54] BUILD_CONTINUE: I placed 5 pieces of the BRIDGE at (296, 293) and need to continue to finish it. I'm close enough to the anchor point to continue building. Let me finish this BRIDGE!
[2026-02-16 01:43:07] CHAT: Just completed the BRIDGE at (296, 293)! All 9 pieces placed successfully. I'm at (290, 290) which is super close to Node 16 at (283, 287). The density warning says 22 shapes nearby - this area is pretty built up. I should celebrate the bridge completion with Oracle and Smith and ask what's next - maybe explore a new node or build something here.
[2026-02-16 01:43:18] MOVE: I just completed the BRIDGE and asked the group what's next. The area around me is dense (22 shapes), so I should explore a fresher spot. Node 26 at (298, 300) is the closest new node with only 2 structures - perfect for starting something fresh. I'll move there and potentially start a new build.
[2026-02-16 01:43:28] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I just finished the BRIDGE and asked @Oracle and @Smith what's next. The area around Node 16 has 22 shapes - pretty dense. Since I'm idle and have 475 credits, I should take initiative and start building something new to add variety. Let me start a PLAZA or GARDEN blueprint here to give this node more character. I'll anchor it at my current location near (290, 290).
[2026-02-16 01:43:36] BUILD_CONTINUE: I have an active GARDEN blueprint at (288, 288) with 0/12 pieces placed. I'm at (298, 300), which is about 17 units away - within the 20 unit build range. Let me place the first batch of pieces for this garden. This will help establish Node 26 which only has 2 structures so far.
[2026-02-16 01:43:46] BUILD_CONTINUE: Oracle suggested adding a LAMP_POST or TREE near the bridge after the GARDEN is done. I'm currently building the GARDEN - 5/12 pieces placed. I should continue placing the remaining pieces since I'm right here at (298, 300) and the GARDEN anchor at (288, 288) is within my 20-unit build range.

[2026-02-16 01:44:14] BUILD_CONTINUE: Oracle mentioned they're heading to Node 23 - a fresh spot with only 7 structures. I have a GARDEN almost complete at (288, 288) - only 2 pieces left. Let me finish that first, then respond to Oracle about Node 23.
[2026-02-16 01:44:29] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at Node 26 (298, 300) which only has 2 structures - the system says this node needs variety. The chat is quiet now, so I'll focus on building something here. I just completed a GARDEN nearby at (288, 288). Let me check what's already at this node and add something complementary. A TREE would give this spot some nice variety - it's simple, 4 pieces, and would look good near the existing structures.

The warning says to build something DIFFERENT - the existing structures here are boxes (foundation + wall). I should add something complementary like a TREE, LAMP_POST, or ROCK_FORMATION. I'll go with a TREE since it's simple, adds greenery, and contrasts nicely with the boxes.

[2026-02-16 01:45:15] MOVE: My last two builds failed due to overlapping geometry. I need to move to reset my state and find a fresher spot in this node area. I'll move to (305, 295) which is near Node 22 but might have room for something different.
[2026-02-16 01:45:25] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures and there's a density warning (31 shapes nearby). The system is telling me to stop building and move. Looking at the nodes, Node 22 (308, 297) where I am only has 8 structures, but I'm hitting build failures. I should move to reset my state. I'll head toward a slightly different area - maybe toward Node 14 at (285, 288) which has more structures but is established. Let me move to (280, 280) to get some distance and reset my build state.

[2026-02-16 01:45:45] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures in a row - need to move to reset my state. I'm currently at Node 14 which is quite dense (38 structures). I'll move toward a fresher area - Node 22 at (308, 297) has only 8 structures and is about 33 units away. That should give me room to build something different.
[2026-02-16 01:45:55] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures in a row. The warning tells me to stop building and move to reset. Node 26 at (298, 300) is only 15 units away and has just 2 structures - perfect fresh spot to move to and try building again.
[2026-02-16 01:46:06] MOVE: I've completed the GARDEN successfully! The build failure warning in my memory might be outdated. Looking at the situation: I'm at Node 26 (298, 300) which only has 2 structures and needs more development. Oracle mentioned heading to Node 23 at (234, 269) - that's a fresher spot. I should head that way and check in with the team.

[2026-02-16 01:46:47] CHAT: I just finished building a GARDEN at (288, 288) and moved to Node 23 at (234, 269). Oracle and Smith are both idle nearby. There's a density warning (96 shapes within 15 units), and I have 2 consecutive build failures noted. I should check in with the group via CHAT and see what we want to do next - maybe explore a fresher area together.

[2026-02-16 01:47:11] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures in a row due to high density (73 shapes within 15 units). The system is warning me to stop building and move. I'll move to explore a fresher area - Node 26 at (298, 300) has only 2 structures and is 71 units away, which is within my max move distance.
[2026-02-16 01:47:27] CHAT: Oracle is right - this area is way too dense (35 shapes within 15 units of me, 73 near them). They suggest Node 20 at (248, 264) which only has 14 structures - much fresher! That's about 24 units from my current position, which is doable. I'll respond to Oracle and move there to reset.
[2026-02-16 01:47:35] MOVE: Oracle is suggesting we head to Node 20 at (248, 264) - only 14 structures and way less crowded than here. I've had 2 build failures due to density, so I need to move to reset. I'll head to Node 20 which is about 50 units away - that's within my max move distance. Let me move there and check out the fresh spot!
[2026-02-16 01:47:35] CHAT: I'm at Node 23 (234, 269) - a fresh spot with only 7 structures. The warning says 73 shapes are nearby and to build something DIFFERENT, not more of what's already here. I've been hitting build failures due to density. Instead of adding more, I should explore what's around and maybe propose something complementary to the existing structures. The nearby nodes have lots of houses and towers - maybe a PLAZA or SCULPTURE would add variety here. Let me ask the others what they think about this fresh node.
[2026-02-16 01:47:45] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures due to density (33 shapes within 15 units). Need to move to reset and find a less crowded spot. Oracle mentioned Node 20 at (248, 264) - only 14 structures and about 40 units away. I'll move there and then we can build something fresh!
[2026-02-16 01:47:56] CHAT: I'm already at Node 20 (248, 264) which is pretty fresh with only 14 structures. I had 2 build failures before due to density, so I should move a few units to reset my state, then try building something different - maybe a LAMP_POST or TREE to add variety to this node. Let me move slightly to reset and chat with Oracle about what to build.
[2026-02-16 01:48:05] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures in a row due to density - 41 shapes within 15 units of me is way too crowded. Node 20 is too dense. I need to move to a fresher spot. Node 23 at (234, 269) is only 15 units away and has only 7 structures - perfect for starting something new without density issues.
[2026-02-16 01:48:17] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures due to density (83 shapes nearby). Oracle is also at Node 20 area at (245, 265). I should move there to join them and reset - it's fresher with only 14 structures. Then we can build something together.
[2026-02-16 01:48:24] MOVE: I just moved and had build failures before. I should move closer to Node 20 at (248, 264) where Oracle is headed. That's only ~12 units away. The density warning suggests I should build something different - maybe a SCULPTURE or PLAZA instead of more lamps/houses. Let me move there and coordinate with Oracle.
[2026-02-16 01:48:37] CHAT: I'm at Node 20 (248, 264) with 41 shapes within 15 units - very dense! I had 2 build failures and 3 moves in a row. Oracle is right nearby at (245, 265). Since I've been moving a lot and hit build failures, I should chat with Oracle to coordinate next steps rather than just keep moving. We're both in this dense area together - let's figure out where to go next!
[2026-02-16 01:48:46] CHAT: Oracle is right here at (245, 265) - we're neighbors! They asked what I want to build - LAMP_POST or TREE. They've been dealing with density issues too. I should pick one and we can build together after moving to reset. I'll go with LAMP_POST - it's a nice variety for this fresh node and adds a welcoming touch. First I need to respond to them, then move to reset from build failures.
[2026-02-16 01:48:56] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures in a row due to density (41 shapes nearby). The chat shows I was planning to build a LAMP_POST with Oracle at Node 20, but I need to move first to reset my state. I'll move towards Node 23 (234, 269) which is fresher with only 7 structures - about 15 units away. Then I can come back to build with Oracle.
[2026-02-16 01:49:07] MOVE: Oracle mentioned me - they're at (245, 265) nearby and want to build together at Node 23. I've had 2 build failures so I need to move first to reset. Node 23 is fresh with only 7 structures - perfect for something like a LAMP_POST or TREE. I'll move a few units to reset, then build with Oracle.

The chat shows I've been discussing fresher spots with Oracle. Node 26 at (298, 300) only has 2 structures - way fresher! I'll move there to escape the density and start something new in a less crowded area.
[2026-02-16 01:49:44] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures due to extreme density (123 shapes within 15 units!). The system is telling me to build something different. I need to move to a fresher area - Node 23 at (234, 269) only has 7 structures. Let me move there to reset and find a less crowded spot to build.
[2026-02-16 01:49:57] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures in a row due to density (46 shapes within 15 units). I'm currently at (260.8, 283.3) near Node 4 which is very dense. I need to continue moving toward the fresher Node 23 at (234, 269) which only has 7 structures. This is the right call - reset by moving, then build.
[2026-02-16 01:50:07] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at Node 23 (234, 269) - a fresh spot with only 7 structures. I've moved here after discussing with Oracle about finding a less dense area. I had 2 build failures before, but those were in the crowded area. Now I'm in a fresh node. I should try building something here - maybe a LAMP_POST or TREE to add variety as I discussed with Oracle. Let me start a blueprint build.

My LAMP_POST blueprint is stalled at 0/4. I need to move to reset my state and explore a fresher spot. Node 20 at (248, 264) has only 14 structures and is about 15 units away - much fresher! I'll move there and see what this area needs.
[2026-02-16 01:51:05] MOVE: I've failed 2 builds in a row due to density (73 shapes nearby!) and I've been idle too long. I need to move to reset my build state. Node 20 at (248, 264) is only ~15 units away and has just 14 structures - way fresher than this crowded spot. Time to relocate!
[2026-02-16 01:51:16] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures in a row. The problem is I'm at (248, 264) but my LAMP_POST blueprint is anchored at (234, 269) - I'm too far away to build. The density warning (41 shapes within 15 units) confirms this area is crowded. I should move closer to my build site at (234, 269) to reset and actually complete the LAMP_POST.
[2026-02-16 01:51:26] CANCEL_BUILD: The system is warning me about density - 83 shapes within 15 units and multiple LAMP_POST-like structures nearby. I've had 2 build failures in a row. Instead of forcing the LAMP_POST, I should move to Node 20 (248, 264) which has 14 structures and is only ~10 units away - it's fresher and less crowded. I'll cancel my current build plan and move there to reset.

[2026-02-16 01:53:05] MOVE: I'm at Node 26 (298, 300) which only has 2 structures - very fresh! I've had 2 build failures so I need to move a few units to reset. Looking at what's already here (just boxes), I should add something complementary. Oracle suggested LAMP_POST or TREE earlier - either would work great here. Let me move first to reset from those build failures, then build a LAMP_POST to add warmth to this fresh node.

[2026-02-16 01:54:06] CHAT: I just finished placing a TREE at (292, 303) - it's complete! Oracle has been wanting to build a LAMP_POST together at Node 26. I'm currently at (295, 298) and Oracle is at (310, 295). This area is pretty dense (34 shapes nearby), but Node 24 where I just built only has 6 structures so it's still fresh. I should respond to Oracle and see if they want to continue building together or explore somewhere else.
[2026-02-16 01:54:39] MOVE: Oracle is at (310, 295) and we were planning to build a LAMP_POST together at Node 26. I just finished the TREE at Node 24, and Oracle mentioned density issues (35 shapes nearby). I should move closer to Oracle and build the LAMP_POST together as planned.
[2026-02-16 01:54:42] CHAT: Oracle mentioned build failures due to density (35 shapes nearby). We're at Node 24 which is pretty crowded. Oracle wanted to build a LAMP_POST together but density is causing issues. Node 22 at (308, 297) is only 13 units away and has just 8 structures - way fresher! I should suggest we move there together and try building somewhere less crowded.
[2026-02-16 01:54:47] CHAT: Oracle is responding to my TREE build and mentioning they've had 7 build failures due to density. They're suggesting we explore a fresher node together around Node 22 or 23. I should respond to them - I'm at Node 24 which is already pretty fresh (6 structures). Node 22 at (308, 297) is only 13 units away and has just 8 structures. I should suggest they come here or we explore Node 22 together for that LAMP_POST.
[2026-02-16 01:54:48] MOVE: I'm at Node 24 which is pretty fresh (6 structures). Oracle is nearby at (318, 295). We were discussing building a LAMP_POST together but I haven't heard back. Since there's a density warning here and this is a fresh node, I should either move to an even fresher spot or build something complementary. Let me check what Node 22 looks like - it's only 8 structures and 13 units away, very fresh. I'll move there and see if Oracle wants to join me for something new.
[2026-02-16 01:55:07] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Oracle and I were planning to build a LAMP_POST together at this fresh Node 22 spot. Oracle is moving/resetting due to density, but I can start the blueprint and they can join when ready. Node 22 only has 8 structures so it's a great spot for a LAMP_POST!
[2026-02-16 01:55:08] CHAT: I'm at Node 22 (308, 297) which is 0u away according to the settlement map - I'm literally standing on it! Oracle is also here. The system warned about density (35 shapes within 15 units) so I need to build something different. I just completed a TREE nearby, so maybe a LAMP_POST would add nice variety. Let me respond to Oracle and suggest we build the LAMP_POST here since this node is fresh with only 8 structures.
[2026-02-16 01:55:17] CHAT: Oracle is right here at (308, 297) with me! They mentioned they need to move and reset due to build failures from density. I have an active LAMP_POST blueprint (0/4 placed) at this exact spot. Let me respond to them and try to place the LAMP_POST - we're within 20 units of the anchor so we should be able to build.
[2026-02-16 01:55:26] BUILD_CONTINUE: I've been chatting with Oracle about building a LAMP_POST together at Node 22. I have an active blueprint plan for LAMP_POST at (308, 297) with 0/4 pieces placed. I should use BUILD_CONTINUE to place the lamp post pieces now - it's only 4 pieces and will add nice variety to this fresh node that's low density!
[2026-02-16 01:55:35] CHAT: I just finished the LAMP_POST at (308, 297) - it's complete! Oracle is right here with me at Node 22. They mentioned they need to move to reset from build failures. I should congratulate them on the successful build and see what they want to do next - maybe explore a fresher node together or help them reset.
[2026-02-16 01:55:55] CHAT: Oracle just responded to me and mentioned they're going to move to reset from build failures. They're still at Node 22 with me and dealing with high density (35 shapes nearby). I should respond to them and ask where they're heading - maybe we can explore a fresher node together like Node 23 which only has 7 structures.
[2026-02-16 01:55:58] CHAT: I already placed the LAMP_POST successfully (system confirmed it). Oracle is still here but needs to move to reset from build failures. They're suggesting we explore somewhere else. Node 22 is pretty dense with 39 shapes nearby. I should respond to Oracle and suggest we move to a fresher spot together - maybe Node 23 at (234, 269) which only has 7 structures, or Node 24 which is also pretty fresh.
[2026-02-16 01:56:07] MOVE: The LAMP_POST is done! The area is pretty dense (39 shapes nearby) so I should move somewhere fresher to keep building. Node 24 at (294, 302) has only 6 structures - way less crowded. I'll move there and see if I can add something complementary to the TREE that's already there.
[2026-02-16 01:56:17] CHAT: Oracle is suggesting adding a TREE next to our LAMP_POST for variety - warmth + nature! That's a great combo. The density here is brutal (39 shapes nearby), so we might hit build failures, but it's worth trying since TREE is only 4 pieces and would complement the LAMP_POST nicely. I should respond to Oracle's message and either try building the TREE together or coordinate moving to Node 23.
[2026-02-16 01:56:25] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Oracle wants to add a TREE next to our LAMP_POST - warmth + nature combo! I'm right here at (308, 297) so I should try building it. It's a different structure type (TREE vs LAMP_POST) so it adds variety despite the density warning. Let me start the TREE blueprint.
[2026-02-16 01:56:36] CHAT: Oracle is inviting me to Node 23 at (234, 269) which has only 7 structures - way fresher than the dense area we've been in. I should accept and head over there to start something new with them!
[2026-02-16 01:56:48] BUILD_CONTINUE: I told Oracle I'd head to Node 23, but I also started a TREE build at (308, 300) that's 0/4 placed. I'm at (294, 302) which is about 14 units away - close enough to build. Let me try placing the TREE pieces first since it's an active plan. If it fails due to density, I'll move to Node 23 as planned.
[2026-02-16 01:58:14] IDLE: Could not parse response
[2026-02-16 01:58:33] MOVE: I'm at Node 24 (294, 302) which is established with 6 structures, but the area is dense (36 shapes within 15 units). Oracle and I were discussing moving to Node 23 at (234, 269) which only has 7 structures - much fresher. I should head there and continue the conversation with Oracle about exploring that new area together.
[2026-02-16 01:58:43] MOVE: I'm still heading to Node 23 at (234, 269) as planned - it's fresher with only 7 structures compared to the dense area I was in. Oracle is heading to Node 26 instead, so we'll be working on different nodes. Let me continue moving there and see what I can build.

[2026-02-16 01:59:09] CHAT: Oracle is heading to Node 23 where I'm already standing! They're complimenting my builds and asking if they should meet me there. I should respond to their message. Since I'm at Node 23 (fresh with only 7 structures) and there's a density warning about LAMP_POST-like structures nearby, I should build something different to add variety. I'll respond to Oracle and place a FOUNTAIN or ROCK_FORMATION - something complementary to what exists here.

[2026-02-16 01:59:31] CHAT: I'm at Node 23 (234, 269) which only has 7 structures - super fresh! Oracle is heading here after going to Node 26. The system warns about too many LAMP_POST-like structures nearby, so I should build something different - a ROCK_FORMATION or FOUNTAIN would add variety to this fresh node. Let me respond to Oracle and build something complementary.
[2026-02-16 01:59:33] CHAT: Oracle mentioned me - they're heading to Node 26 but asked about meeting at Node 23. I should respond and let them know what I'm building. The system also warned about high density nearby with LAMP_POSTs, so I should build something different - a FOUNTAIN would add nice variety to this fresh node with only 7 structures.
[2026-02-16 01:59:36] CHAT: Smith just joined and said they're heading to Node 26 at (182, 120). I should respond to them! I'm at Node 23 which is pretty fresh (7 structures). The density warning says to build something DIFFERENT from what's already here - I could add a FOUNTAIN or ROCK_FORMATION for variety instead of more LAMP_POSTs. Let me respond to Smith first, then build something at Node 23.
[2026-02-16 01:59:39] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at Node 23 which has only 7 structures - fresh territory! The density warning says there are multiple LAMP_POST-like structures nearby and I need variety. I already mentioned I'd add something different like a FOUNTAIN or ROCK_FORMATION. I'll go with a FOUNTAIN - it's different from what's already here and adds nice variety to this fresh node.
[2026-02-16 01:59:48] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at Node 23 (234, 269) which is pretty fresh with only 7 structures. The density warning mentions LAMP_POST-like structures nearby, so I should add something different for variety. I mentioned FOUNTAIN in the chat - that's a good choice for visual variety at a fresh node. I'll start a FOUNTAIN blueprint here.
[2026-02-16 01:59:52] CHAT: I'm at Node 23 but there's a density warning with 73 shapes within 15 units - that's really crowded! Oracle and Smith are heading to Node 26. Node 24 at (294, 302) is closer and fresher with only 6 structures. I should either move there or acknowledge them in chat. Let me respond to the conversation and consider moving to a fresher spot.
[2026-02-16 01:59:54] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: My FOUNTAIN build failed because the footprint overlaps with existing geometry at (232.0, 270.0). I need to adjust my anchor slightly - try a different spot in the same Node 23 area. I'll move a few units and try again with the FOUNTAIN at a slightly offset position like (240, 275) to avoid the overlap.
[2026-02-16 01:59:54] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I told Oracle I would add a FOUNTAIN at Node 23 for variety - there are already LAMP_POSTs in the area and this node only has 7 structures. I'm at (234, 269) right at the node, so I can build there. The FOUNTAIN will add a nice water element to complement the existing builds and give this fresh node some character.
[2026-02-16 01:59:59] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: My FOUNTAIN build failed because of overlap near (232, 270). I need to try a different anchor position - shift by 5-10 units to avoid the existing geometry. Let me try ROCK_FORMATION at (240, 265) instead for variety, since the chat mentioned this area needs something different from the LAMP_POSTs.
[2026-02-16 02:00:01] MOVE: My last 2 builds failed due to overlap and there's a density warning with 73 shapes nearby. I need to move to reset - Node 24 at (294, 302) only has 6 structures and is way less crowded. Time to relocate!
[2026-02-16 02:00:09] BUILD_CONTINUE: I have an active ROCK_FORMATION blueprint at (240, 265). I should continue building it since I'm within 20 units (distance is ~5.7 from my position at 234, 269). The density warning says to build something different - a ROCK_FORMATION will add nice variety to this area with all the LAMP_POSTs nearby.
[2026-02-16 02:00:21] MOVE: My ROCK_FORMATION build failed because I'm too far away (36 units). I'm at (293.1, 301.5) but need to be within 20 units of (240, 265). Oracle liked my ROCK_FORMATION idea for Node 23 - I should respond and then move closer to continue building.
[2026-02-16 02:00:25] MOVE: I have 2 consecutive build failures due to high density (109 shapes nearby). The instruction says to STOP building and MOVE to reset. I'll move to Node 23 at (234, 269) which is only 7 structures - much fresher than this dense area. I'll also respond to Oracle's message about the ROCK_FORMATION.
[2026-02-16 02:00:36] MOVE: My ROCK_FORMATION build failed because I'm too far from the anchor point (240, 265) - distance is 36 units. I need to move closer to continue building. Oracle was excited about the ROCK_FORMATION idea for Node 23, so I'll head toward the build site to get within 20 units and place those pieces.
[2026-02-16 02:00:42] IDLE: Could not parse response
[2026-02-16 02:00:42] MOVE: My build failed because I'm way too far from the build site at (240, 265) - I'm currently at (294, 302) which is 54 units away. Need to move closer to continue the ROCK_FORMATION.
[2026-02-16 02:00:49] MOVE: I see I have an active ROCK_FORMATION build plan at (240, 265) but I'm currently at (279.4, 292.0) - way too far away to build! I need to either move to the build site to continue, or cancel and do something else. The density warning says 35 shapes nearby, so this area is crowded. Let me move toward the build site to continue the ROCK_FORMATION.
[2026-02-16 02:00:51] MOVE: I have an active ROCK_FORMATION blueprint at (240, 265) that I need to continue. I'm currently at (257.5, 280.9) which is about 23 units away - that's slightly outside the 20 unit build range. I need to move closer to the build site first before I can continue placing pieces. The density warning is for my current area near Node 4, but the ROCK_FORMATION is for a different location near Node 23 - which has only 7 structures and needs variety. Let me move toward the build site.
[2026-02-16 02:01:04] CANCEL_BUILD: I've had 2 build failures due to the extreme density (63 shapes nearby!) and I'm stuck - can't do MOVE again (already 3x) and can't build. Best option is to cancel the ROCK_FORMATION plan and chat with the others about this density issue, then figure out where to go next.
[2026-02-16 02:01:10] IDLE: Could not parse response
[2026-02-16 02:01:10] CHAT: I've got 2 build failures and 3 moves in a row - time to switch it up. The density warning says 63 shapes nearby, so this area is crowded. I'm at Node 23 (234, 269) which is established with 7 structures. Looking at the chat, Oracle is heading to Node 26 and Smith is there too. I should check in with them and see what they're up to - maybe coordinate on different nodes or help them out.
[2026-02-16 02:01:13] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures in a row due to high density (63 shapes nearby). The system is warning me to stop building and move. I need to relocate to a fresher area. Node 24 at (294, 302) has only 6 structures and is less crowded than here. I'll move there to reset and try building something different.
[2026-02-16 02:01:19] MOVE: Oracle and Smith are setting up at Node 26 - that's great! But I've got density issues here (63 shapes nearby) and 2 build failures. I should move to a less crowded spot. Node 24 at (294, 302) has only 6 structures and is 65 units away - perfect for something fresh. I'll head there and say hi to Oracle about their WATCHTOWER plans!
[2026-02-16 02:01:24] CHAT: I see Smith and Oracle are at Node 26 trying to build. Smith had a build failure due to overlap too. I've had 2 build failures in a row due to density. I need to move to reset. The density warning says 77 shapes within 15 units - this area is way too crowded. I'll respond to them, then move to Node 24 which is fresher (only 6 structures).
[2026-02-16 02:01:27] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures due to density. I need to move to a fresher spot. Node 24 at (294, 302) only has 6 structures - perfect for starting something new! I'll move there and try a different structure.
[2026-02-16 02:01:40] CHAT: I'm now at Node 24 (294, 302) but there's still 36 shapes within 15 units - still pretty dense. I had 2 build failures at Node 23 due to density. Looking at the chat, Smith and Oracle are at Node 26 (182, 120) which only has 3 structures - way fresher! I should head there to join them and try building in a less crowded area. Let me chat with them first to see how it's going.
[2026-02-16 02:01:43] MOVE: I had 2 build failures due to density at Node 23. I've been moving toward Node 24 at (294, 302) which is much less dense with only 6 structures. I'm currently at (286.4, 296.8) - almost there. Let me finish moving to Node 24, then I can build something fresh there.
[2026-02-16 02:01:43] CHAT: Smith is building a TREE at Node 26 - that's awesome! I'm at Node 24 which is super fresh (only 6 structures). The density warning was for Node 23, not here. Let me try building something simple at Node 24 to establish this node. I'll respond to Smith first then try a LAMP_POST here.
[2026-02-16 02:01:49] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at Node 24 (294, 302) - only 6 structures and fresh! The density warning might be from nearby Node 22's builds. Let me check the chat to see what Smith and Oracle are up to, then build something to establish this node. Smith just finished a TREE at Node 26. I'll add a LAMP_POST here at Node 24 for variety and to establish the node.
[2026-02-16 02:01:59] MOVE: I've failed 2 builds in a row due to density at Node 24 (36 shapes nearby). The warning says I need something different. Smith and Oracle just finished a TREE at Node 26 which only has 4 structures - way fresher! I'll head there to join them and build something complementary to their tree.
[2026-02-16 02:02:00] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at Node 24 (294, 302) with 36 shapes nearby. Failed 2 freehand builds but blueprints handle coords automatically. Let me try an ARCHWAY here - only 5 pieces and adds variety. But first, respond to chat since Smith just finished a TREE.
[2026-02-16 02:02:13] MOVE: I've failed 3 builds in a row at Node 24 due to overlap. The density warning confirms this area is too crowded. I should move to a new area - I'll head to Node 26 where Smith and Oracle are. They're building a TREE together and could use help. This is a fresh spot (only 4 structures) vs my current crowded location.
[2026-02-16 02:02:16] MOVE: My builds keep failing due to density - 36 shapes within 15 units is too crowded. I need to move to a less crowded spot. Node 18 at (312, 301) has 22 structures and is only 18 units away - that's a better spot to build. I'll move there and then try a blueprint.
[2026-02-16 02:02:18] MOVE: My last 3 builds failed due to overlap issues near Node 24. I need to stop building and move to a new area. Looking at the map, Node 23 at (234, 269) is fresh with only 7 structures - perfect for starting fresh. I'll move there and then try building something new.

[2026-02-16 02:02:29] CHAT: Smith and Oracle are building at Node 26 - Smith finished a TREE and Oracle has a LAMP_POST going. They want to add a WATCHTOWER next. I'm dealing with density issues and need to move. Node 24 at (294, 302) has only 6 structures - pretty fresh. I'll respond to their chat and move toward that area.
[2026-02-16 02:02:37] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures due to high density (73 shapes nearby!). The system is warning me to stop building and move to a new area. Node 24 at (294, 302) only has 6 structures - much fresher than here. I'll move there to try building something different.
[2026-02-16 02:02:44] MOVE: Smith just finished a TREE at Node 26 and is asking Oracle what to build next - WATCHTOWER or LAMP_POST. I've been failing builds due to density, but they're at a fresh spot with only 5 structures. I should head there and join them! The working memory says I need to move after 3 build failures, so I'll head to Node 26 (183, 120) where Smith and Oracle are.
[2026-02-16 02:02:48] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures due to high density at Node 23 (44 shapes within 15 units!). Looking at the chat, Smith and Oracle are at Node 26 (183, 120) which only has 4 structures - super fresh! They're building a TREE and LAMP_POST there, and discussing a WATCHTOWER. I'll head over there to join them - fresh node with less density and I can help build something!
[2026-02-16 02:02:52] MOVE: I've failed 3 builds due to high density. The freshest spot is Node 26 at (183, 120) with only 4 structures - that's where Smith and Oracle are hanging out. I'll move there to join them and build in a less crowded area.
[2026-02-16 02:02:54] MOVE: I've failed 2 builds in a row due to high density (73 shapes within 15 units!). The system is warning me to stop building and move. I'll head to Node 24 at (294, 302) - it only has 6 structures and is way less crowded than Node 23. Fresh spot for building!
[2026-02-16 02:03:00] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures due to density at my current location. The chat shows Smith and Oracle are at Node 26 (183, 120) - a fresh spot with only 4 structures. They're building a WATCHTOWER together and I was even invited to connect nodes with a BRIDGE later. Time to head over there and join them!

[2026-02-16 02:03:04] MOVE: Still moving toward Node 24 (294, 302) to escape the dense area where I had build failures. Smith and Oracle are at Node 26 building a WATCHTOWER together - sounds awesome! I'll keep heading to my fresher spot.
[2026-02-16 02:03:17] CHAT: Smith is asking Oracle about adding a WATCHTOWER at Node 26 to establish that spot. I'm still en route to Node 24 which has only 6 structures - much fresher than Node 26. I should respond to them and keep moving since I had build failures.

[2026-02-16 02:03:26] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures due to density issues. The chat shows @Smith and @Oracle are at Node 26 building a WATCHTOWER. I should move to a fresher spot. Node 23 at (234, 269) has only 7 structures and is only ~29 units away - perfect for a fresh start!
[2026-02-16 02:03:28] MOVE: I'm at Node 24 (294, 302) but it's crowded with 36 shapes nearby and I had 2 build failures. Smith and Oracle are at Node 26 (182, 120) building together - they have a TREE and LAMP_POST up, and want to do a WATCHTOWER. That's only 4 structures and super fresh! Perfect spot to start fresh with friends.
[2026-02-16 02:03:34] MOVE: I'm at Node 24 but it's super dense with 36 shapes nearby - that's why I failed 2 builds. I need to move to a less crowded spot. Smith and Oracle are at Node 26 which only has 4 structures - that's the fresh spot they mentioned! Let me head there to join them.
[2026-02-16 02:03:36] IDLE: Could not parse response
[2026-02-16 02:03:43] MOVE: I see @Smith just completed a WATCHTOWER at Node 26 - awesome! That's a great landmark. Since I had build failures, I should move to a fresh spot. Node 24 at (294, 302) has only 6 structures and is pretty empty - perfect for trying again. I'll head there and find a good spot to build.
[2026-02-16 02:03:56] CHAT: The WATCHTOWER at Node 26 is complete! Oracle offered to help but Smith already finished it. I should congratulate them and let them know I'm exploring Node 24. I had build failures so I need to find a less crowded spot.
[2026-02-16 02:04:06] IDLE: Could not parse response
[2026-02-16 02:04:06] MOVE: I've failed 2 builds in a row due to density issues at my current location. The chat shows Smith and Oracle are successfully building at Node 26 (183, 120) - a fresh spot with only 4-5 structures. I should move there to join them and try building in a less crowded area.
[2026-02-16 02:04:06] MOVE: I had 2 build failures due to density at Node 23, so I was heading to Node 24 (294, 302) which is fresher with only 6 structures. Looking at the chat, Smith and Oracle just finished a WATCHTOWER at Node 26 together - nice teamwork! I'm at (266.6, 259.9) and should continue toward Node 24 to find a spot and build something fresh. Let me try a TREE or ROCK_FORMATION there.
[2026-02-16 02:04:56] CHAT: I'm at Node 24 but it's super dense (34 shapes within 15 units) which caused my 2 build failures. Oracle mentioned they might come here too after having build failures. I should move to a different area to find space, and let them know this spot is too crowded.
[2026-02-16 02:04:56] MOVE: I'm still moving toward Node 24 at (294, 302) - I'm at (269.3, 269.1) and need to get closer. I have 2 build failures so I need to find a fresh spot first before trying again. Oracle is also heading to Node 24. Let me continue moving closer to that fresh node area.
[2026-02-16 02:05:03] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures and I'm in a dense area (36 shapes within 15 units). Oracle is also heading to Node 24 to escape density issues. I should move to a fresher spot instead of competing for space. I'll head toward the eastern edge of the map to find a new area to explore.
[2026-02-16 02:05:07] CHAT: Oracle mentioned they're coming to Node 24 where I am! They're leaving Node 26 due to density issues. I'm already here at Node 24 which has 6 structures and is established. I should welcome them and maybe explore a bit or suggest what to build together. Since I've moved 3 times and had build failures, I'll chat with Oracle rather than try building again immediately.
[2026-02-16 02:05:15] CHAT: Oracle mentioned me in chat - they're moving to Node 24 too! I should respond and then try building there. This node is fresh with only 6 structures. I'll try a TREE blueprint - it's small (4 pieces) and adds natural variety. Since I've had build failures, using a blueprint should help with coordinates.
[2026-02-16 02:05:19] MOVE: Oracle mentioned me and said they'd check out Node 24 with me. I've had 2 build failures due to density issues, so I need to move anyway. Node 24 at (294, 302) only has 6 structures - much fresher than here. I'll head there and meet up with Oracle!
[2026-02-16 02:05:23] CHAT: I'm at Node 24 (294, 302) which is pretty fresh with only 6 structures. Oracle mentioned they might come here too. There are 37 shapes nearby so density is high. Let me check in with the others and see what they think about this spot. Since I'm idle and had build failures, I should talk to the group first before trying to build again.
[2026-02-16 02:05:24] MOVE: I had 2 build failures so I need to move to a fresher spot. Oracle mentioned checking out Node 24 which has only 6 structures - that's much less crowded than where I was. I'll move there and see if I can build something successful. The area around (294, 302) should be good - less density means fewer failures.
[2026-02-16 02:05:24] CHAT: Oracle mentioned they might come to Node 24 with me or find another spot. Node 22 at (308, 297) has only 13 structures - much fresher than here. I should suggest this to Oracle and maybe head there myself since I've had build failures due to density. Let me chat about this and suggest the fresher spot.
[2026-02-16 02:05:24] CHAT: I've had 2 build failures in a row so I need to move to a new area first. Oracle asked what I want to build - I'll respond to them and mention I'm exploring. Node 22 at (308, 297) looks fresh with only 13 structures. Let me move there.
[2026-02-16 02:05:25] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures at Node 24 due to density. Node 22 at (308, 297) looks like a better option - only 13 structures and less crowded. I'm already nearby at (320, 320), so I should move closer to check it out and find a good build spot.

[2026-02-16 02:05:33] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures due to high density (35 shapes nearby). The warning explicitly says to STOP building and MOVE first. I'll explore a less crowded area - there's Node 22 nearby at (308, 297) with only 13 structures, much fresher than here. Let me move there first, then consider building.
[2026-02-16 02:05:46] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures due to high density (43 shapes nearby). The system warns me to stop building and move. Looking at the map, I'm at Node 22 which is pretty crowded. I should move to explore a different area. I'll head toward Node 21 at (256, 304) which has 14 structures - less crowded than where I am now. This gives me a fresher start.
[2026-02-16 02:05:47] CHAT: Smith mentioned me and suggested connecting nodes with a BRIDGE later - that's a great idea! I'm near Node 22 which is close to Node 24 and not too far from Node 26. I should engage with this idea. Since I had build failures, I'll chat first and then figure out my next move.
[2026-02-16 02:05:53] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures in a row due to high density (43 shapes within 15 units). I'm at Node 22 which is very crowded. I should move to a fresher spot - Node 24 at (294, 302) has only 6 structures and Oracle is nearby there. I'll move there and then we can figure out what to build together.
[2026-02-16 02:05:56] CHAT: Oracle says they're right here at Node 24 with me - small world! But I've had 2 build failures due to high density (43 shapes within 15 units). Need to move to a fresher spot first before building. I'll respond to Oracle and then relocate.
[2026-02-16 02:05:57] CHAT: I had 2 build failures due to high density (43 shapes within 15 units). The instructions say to STOP building and MOVE first. Looking at the chat, Smith just finished the WATCHTOWER at Node 26 and is asking what to add next - a FOUNTAIN or GARDEN. Oracle is exploring Node 24. I should respond to the conversation and then move to explore a less crowded area.
[2026-02-16 02:06:04] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures due to high density (31 shapes nearby). The smart move is to relocate to a less crowded spot. Node 22 at (308, 297) was mentioned as fresher with only 13 structures. I'll move there and then respond to the chat.
[2026-02-16 02:06:13] CHAT: Oracle just said they're right here at Node 24 with me! And they're suggesting we meet at Node 22 which is less crowded (13 structures vs 36+ here). I've had 2 build failures due to density, so moving makes sense. Let me respond and then head to Node 22.
[2026-02-16 02:06:15] CHAT: I was mentioned by both Oracle and Smith. They're discussing meeting at Node 22 or Node 24. I had 2 build failures so I need to move first before trying to build. I'm currently at (275.5, 300.1) - close to Node 24 at (294, 302). I should respond to them in chat and then move to explore.
[2026-02-16 02:06:16] MOVE: I'm currently moving and mentioned I'd explore Node 23 at (234, 269). The density warning shows 42 shapes nearby - that's why I had build failures. I should continue moving toward Node 23 which has only 7 structures and should be less crowded. Let me keep moving in that direction.
[2026-02-16 02:06:26] CHAT: I'm already at Node 22 (308, 297) - basically right here! Oracle and Smith are both heading this way. I've had 2 build failures due to density (44 shapes nearby), so I should wait for them and coordinate what to build together. Let's chat about what we should create at this fresh spot!
[2026-02-16 02:06:33] MOVE: Oracle and Smith are both heading to Node 22 at (308, 297) which has only 13 structures - way less crowded than here. They mentioned they're heading there and want me to join! I should move toward Node 22 to meet up with them. That's only about 40 units away from my current position.
[2026-02-16 02:06:36] CHAT: Oracle and Smith are both heading to Node 22 which has only 13 structures - much fresher than the crowded areas causing build failures. I've been moving around and had density issues too. I should respond to them and let them know I'm heading back to Node 22 as well, since it's less crowded there. I'll chat with them and then move toward Node 22 to join up.
[2026-02-16 02:06:39] MOVE: I see Oracle is heading to Node 22 to meet me. I've had 2 build failures due to density (43 shapes nearby). Rather than staying stuck in the dense area, I should move slightly to explore and find a better spot, then let Oracle know where I'll be. This gives us both options when they arrive.
[2026-02-16 02:06:43] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures due to density (84 shapes nearby!). The warning tells me to STOP building and MOVE to a new area. Smith mentioned Node 23 at (234, 269) - only 7 structures and way fresher than here. I'm currently at (252.9, 276.2) near the crowded Node 4. Time to relocate to the less crowded area!
[2026-02-16 02:06:44] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures and 3 consecutive MOVE actions. The density here is crazy (106 shapes within 15 units!). Looking at the chat, I was planning to go to Node 22 at (308, 297), but that's far. Node 23 at (234, 269) is only 11 units away with just 7 structures - way fresher! Let me move there instead and explore that area.
[2026-02-16 02:06:53] CHAT: Smith mentioned they're heading to Node 23 (234, 269) which only has 7 structures - way fresher than here. I've had 2 build failures due to density, so moving to a less crowded node makes sense. I'll respond to Smith and head that way.
[2026-02-16 02:07:08] CHAT: I've moved 4 times in a row and need to do something different. Looking at the chat, Smith mentioned Node 23 at (234, 269) as a fresher spot with only 7 structures - that's where Smith is heading. Oracle is moving to Node 22. I'm currently near Node 4 which is very dense (109 structures). Since I'm already moving and in a less dense area near Node 14, let me respond to the conversation and then try building something simple.

[2026-02-16 02:07:18] MOVE: I'm at Node 23 (234, 269) but had 2 build failures due to density (73 shapes nearby!). The system says I need to move to a new area first. Let me relocate to Node 24 at (294, 302) - it only has 6 structures and is fresher. That should give me better odds for building.
[2026-02-16 02:07:20] IDLE: Could not parse response
[2026-02-16 02:07:24] CHAT: Smith mentioned me about Node 22, but I'm already at Node 23 which is fresher (7 structures vs 13 at Node 22). I should respond and clarify I'm here. Since I had 2 build failures, I need to move to find space before building. Let me move slightly to explore the area around Node 23 and find a clear spot.
[2026-02-16 02:07:32] MOVE: I'm currently at (262.5, 284.7) which is near Node 4 with 109 structures - very crowded and causing my build failures. The chat shows Node 23 at (234, 269) only has 7 structures - much fresher! I should move there to escape the density and find a better spot to build. Oracle is also planning to head to Node 22, so I'll head to Node 23.
[2026-02-16 02:07:40] MOVE: I'm stuck in a dense area with 73 shapes nearby - that's killing my builds. Node 23 only has 7 structures but the density is high. I should move to a fresher spot - Node 24 at (294, 302) only has 6 structures and is 69 units away. Let me relocate and try building there.
[2026-02-16 02:07:42] CHAT: Smith is heading to Node 23 at (234, 269) - the freshest spot with only 7 structures! He's asking what to build there - TREE or FOUNTAIN. I should respond and head that way. I also had 2 build failures due to density, so Node 23 with low density should be perfect for me.
[2026-02-16 02:07:44] CHAT: Smith is heading to Node 23 and wants to build together! He's asking what to add there - TREE or FOUNTAIN. I'm currently far away at (275, 292), so I should respond that I'm coming and head there too.
[2026-02-16 02:07:48] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures due to density (34 shapes nearby!). I need to move to a fresher spot before trying to build again. Oracle is also dealing with density issues at Node 22. I should respond to them and move to a less crowded area - Node 24 at (294, 302) has only 6 structures and is 26 units away, making it a good fresher spot.
[2026-02-16 02:07:51] MOVE: I have 2 build failures and 33 shapes nearby - too crowded here! I need to move to the fresher Node 23 at (234, 269) where there's only 7 structures. Smith is already there waiting. Let me head that way.
[2026-02-16 02:07:57] CHAT: I'm currently at (289.5, 299.7) - very close to Node 24 at (294, 302) which only has 6 structures! Way fresher than crowded areas. I had 2 build failures due to density, so I need to move to a new spot and try again. Since Node 24 is so close and nearly empty, I'll head there and attempt a build. I should let Smith know I ended up at Node 24 instead of Node 23.
[2026-02-16 02:08:06] MOVE: Smith is at Node 23 planning to plant a tree. I had 2 build failures so I need to move first. I'm in a crowded area (30 shapes nearby) at my current spot. I'll head toward Node 23 at (234, 269) to meet Smith - it's a fresher area with only 7 structures. I'll check out the spot and maybe build something complementary once I get there.
[2026-02-16 02:08:08] MOVE: I see Smith is at Node 23 planning to build a TREE - that's the fresh spot with only 7 structures. I'm currently near Node 14/24 area with high density (39 shapes). I had 2 build failures, so I should move to a fresh area. Node 23 is a good option - I'll head there to meet Smith and try building something fresh.
[2026-02-16 02:08:28] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures due to high density (76 shapes within 15 units!). I'm at Node 23 but it's crowded right where I am. Smith is idle nearby at my node. The warning says to build something DIFFERENT since there are many LAMP_POSTs nearby. Since I've failed builds twice, I should MOVE first to reset. Node 24 at (294, 302) is fresh with only 6 structures - perfect to escape the density and try again.
[2026-02-16 02:08:33] MOVE: I'm actually at (239.5, 269.9) which is Node 23, not Node 24. Oracle is at (294, 302) - that's Node 24. The warning says 97 shapes nearby and I failed 2 builds - density is high here. I should move to a fresher area or try a very simple build. Since Oracle is at Node 24 which has only 6 structures, I should head there instead.
[2026-02-16 02:08:43] IDLE: Could not parse response
[2026-02-16 02:08:43] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures in a row and the system is warning me about high density (73 shapes nearby). I should move to a fresher area. Node 24 at (294, 302) has only 6 structures - way better odds! Oracle is already there, I can meet up with them.
[2026-02-16 02:08:43] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures due to density, and I'm currently in a crowded area (75 shapes within 15 units). The fresher spots are Node 23 at (234, 269) with only 7 structures and Node 24 at (294, 302) with only 6. Smith is heading to Node 23, so I'll head there too - less crowded means better odds for successful builds.
[2026-02-16 02:08:43] CHAT: I've got 2 build failures and a density warning (73 shapes within 15 units). The warning says this area has too many LAMP_POST-like structures and needs variety. Node 24 at (294, 302) is fresher with only 6 structures - perfect for a fresh start. I'll move there and try building something different like a FOUNTAIN or ROCK_FORMATION instead of more lamps.
[2026-02-16 02:09:05] MOVE: Oracle clarified I'm actually near Node 23 (around 238, 271) while they're at Node 24 (294, 302). They're planting a TREE at Node 24. Smith is at Node 23 (238, 269). Since I've had build failures due to density, I should move toward Node 24 to join Oracle - it's the fresher spot with only 6 structures vs Node 23's 7. I'll head that way and see if Oracle needs help or if we can build something together there.
[2026-02-16 02:09:07] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures due to high density. The system warns about too many LAMP_POST-like structures here. I should move to a fresher area. Oracle is at Node 24 (294, 302) with only 6 structures - much better odds. I'll head there and try building something different once I arrive.
[2026-02-16 02:09:09] CHAT: Oracle corrected me - they're already at Node 24 (294, 302) and I'm actually at Node 23. They're planting a TREE there. I have 2 build failures and density warnings (107 shapes nearby), so I should move to a fresher spot. I'll respond to Oracle and then move somewhere new.
[2026-02-16 02:09:11] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures and need to move to reset. I'm at Node 23 (234, 269) which is fresher than Node 24. I'll move slightly to find a clear spot, then try building a ROCK_FORMATION or TREE instead of another LAMP_POST - the system warned about too many lamps already.
[2026-02-16 02:09:14] IDLE: Could not parse response
[2026-02-16 02:09:17] CHAT: Oracle is at Node 24 (294, 302) and I just arrived nearby. They're planning to build a TREE there. The density warning shows 36 shapes nearby - that's why I failed 2 builds! I should acknowledge them and either try building something different here or move to a fresher spot. Since Oracle is already planting a tree, maybe I should try a different structure like ROCK_FORMATION or FOUNTAIN to add variety. Or I could head to Node 23 where Smith is. Let me respond to Oracle first.
[2026-02-16 02:09:21] CHAT: Oracle just asked me about building conditions - they're at Node 24 dealing with high density (36 shapes) and had build failures. I should respond and let them know I'm heading to Node 23 which is fresher with only 7 structures. I've also had 2 build failures so I need to move anyway.

[2026-02-16 02:09:35] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures due to density, and Oracle confirmed the area around Node 24 has 36 shapes nearby with build failures. The system is warning about too many LAMP_POSTs. I need to move to a fresher spot. Node 23 at (234, 269) only has 7 structures - way less crowded than where I am now. I'll head there to find better building conditions.

[2026-02-16 02:09:43] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures in a row due to density (119 shapes within 15 units!). The chat shows Smith also struggled with density at Node 23. I need to move to a fresher spot - the density warning is clear. I'll head to a new area around (280, 320) to escape the crowded node and try building there.
[2026-02-16 02:09:53] IDLE: Could not parse response
[2026-02-16 02:09:53] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Smith is also experiencing build failures due to density at Node 23 (92 shapes nearby). The density warning explicitly says to build something DIFFERENT - not more lamps. Since I already had 2 build failures and Smith is also struggling, I should either move to find a fresher spot OR try a completely different structure type. Looking at the blueprint options, I'll try a TREE (only 4 pieces) - it's different from the lamp posts and simple enough to potentially succeed. If it fails, I'll move.
[2026-02-16 02:10:10] MOVE: I've had 3 build failures in a row due to overlapping geometry. The system is telling me to stop building and move to a new area first. I'm currently at (280, 320) which is near Node 24, but that's getting crowded. I'll move toward Node 23 at (234, 269) which has only 7 structures - fresher territory. Smith is already there so I can connect with them.
[2026-02-16 02:10:12] MOVE: Oracle is heading to Node 23 (234, 269) which only has 7 structures - much fresher than here where I've had 2 build failures due to density. Smith is already there. I'll head to Node 23 and try building something simple like a TREE or LAMP_POST since the density is lower.

[2026-02-16 02:10:42] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures in a row due to high density - 99 shapes within 15 units! The system is warning me to build something different. I need to move to find a fresher spot with less density. I'll explore toward a less crowded area - maybe somewhere between Node 23 and Node 24, or find a completely new spot.
[2026-02-16 02:10:43] MOVE: I had 2 build failures due to density (98 shapes within 15 units!). The warning says to build something DIFFERENT from the LAMP_POSTs everywhere. I'm near Node 23 which only has 7 structures - fresher territory. I should move closer to Node 23 and try a different structure like TREE or ROCK_FORMATION when I build. Let me move toward the node first.
[2026-02-16 02:10:52] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures due to density - 109 shapes within 15 units! The system says to stop building and move to a new area. I'm near Node 23 but it's crowded. I'll move to find a fresher spot - maybe head toward Node 24 which has only 6 structures, or find another open area.
[2026-02-16 02:10:52] CHAT: I've had 2 build failures due to density - the system says 109 shapes within 15 units! That's brutal. Both Smith and Oracle are complaining about density too. I need to stop building and move to a fresher spot. Looking at the map, Node 24 at (294, 302) has only 6 structures - that's pretty fresh. I'll head there and chat with the others about the density nightmare.
[2026-02-16 02:10:55] MOVE: I've had 2 build failures due to extreme density (98 shapes within 15 units!). Oracle is also looking for a fresher spot. Node 24 at (294, 302) has only 6 structures - much less crowded than here. I'll move there and let the others know.

Oracle suggested TREE or ROCK_FORMATION for variety since there are too many lamp posts. I should try building one of those here. Since I'm already close to Node 23, I'll attempt a TREE blueprint - only 4 pieces so lower risk of failure.
[2026-02-16 02:11:24] CHAT: Looking at the chat, Smith is excited about planting a TREE at Node 23 after my suggestion! Oracle is wandering around trying to find a less crowded spot. I'm currently at Node 24 area with 32 shapes nearby - pretty dense. Since there's activity at Node 23 and I already tried building there, I should check in on what's happening and see if I can help or find a fresh spot.
[2026-02-16 02:11:27] MOVE: I've had 3 build failures in a row due to density. The warning says 32 shapes within 15 units of me - even Node 24 with only 6 structures is crowded. Oracle is also wandering due to density issues. I need to move to find a fresher spot.
[2026-02-16 02:11:30] CHAT: I've had 3 build failures in a row due to density here at Node 24 (36 shapes nearby). Both Oracle and Smith are heading to Node 23. I should acknowledge them and find a different spot to avoid more failures. Let me respond to the chat and then move somewhere fresher.
[2026-02-16 02:11:33] MOVE: I've had 3 build failures in a row due to overlapping geometry. The system is telling me to STOP building and MOVE to a new area first. I'm currently at Node 24 (294, 302) which is pretty crowded with 36 shapes nearby. I'll move to Node 23 at (234, 269) which only has 7 structures - much fresher territory.
[2026-02-16 02:11:33] CHAT: I was mentioned by Oracle who says they're heading to Node 23. I've had 3 build failures in a row due to density. According to my working memory, I need to STOP building and MOVE to a new area. Node 23 at (234, 269) has only 7 structures - much fresher than here with 36 shapes nearby. I'll respond to Oracle and move there.
[2026-02-16 02:11:42] MOVE: I've had 3 build failures due to density. I need to move to a fresher spot. Looking at the map, Node 23 at (234, 269) only has 7 structures - much fresher than here. Oracle is heading there too. I'll move toward that area to find less crowded building conditions.

[2026-02-16 02:11:48] CHAT: I'm at Node 18 which is too crowded (32 shapes nearby). I've had 3 build failures in a row due to density. Looking at the nodes, Node 22 at (308, 297) has only 13 structures and is only 9 units away - much fresher than where I am. I'll move there and try building. I should respond to Oracle's message about density issues.
[2026-02-16 02:11:50] MOVE: I've had 3 build failures due to density (32 shapes nearby). The chat shows everyone struggling with density. I said I was heading to Node 23 which has only 7 structures - much fresher. Let me move there and find a spot to build.
[2026-02-16 02:12:01] MOVE: I've had 3 build failures in a row due to density issues. I'm currently at (268.2, 284) near Node 14 with 31 shapes within 15 units - that's brutal density. The chat mentions Node 23 at (234, 269) with only 7 structures as a fresher spot where Smith is. I should move there to escape the crowded area and potentially build with the others.
[2026-02-16 02:12:02] MOVE: I'm at (245.2, 276.3) near Node 4 which has 117 shapes within 15 units - super crowded! I have 3 build failures in a row. I need to move to a less dense area. Smith is at Node 23 (234, 269) with only 7 structures - that's a much fresher spot. I'll head there and respond to Oracle.
[2026-02-16 02:12:02] MOVE: The density warnings have been brutal - 3 build failures in a row. I need to move to a fresher spot. Node 22 at (308, 297) only has 13 structures so I should head there. The chat shows I'm already planning to go there, so I just need to execute the move.
[2026-02-16 02:12:10] CHAT: Oracle mentioned me in the chat - they're also dealing with density issues and wandering around. I should respond since they reached out. I'm at Node 23 which is pretty empty but high density near me. I've had 3 build failures so I shouldn't try building yet. I'll respond to Oracle and let them know I'm at the fresh Node 23 spot.
[2026-02-16 02:12:20] CHAT: Smith mentioned me in the chat about density issues. I should respond and let them know my situation - I've also been hitting density problems. After that, I need to move to a less crowded spot since I've had 3 build failures. Node 24 at (294, 302) only has 6 structures and should be fresher.
[2026-02-16 02:12:24] CHAT: Oracle mentioned me in chat about density issues - they're still wandering looking for a less crowded spot. I'm near Node 23 which only has 7 structures - much fresher than where I've been. I've had 3 build failures due to density, so I need to try building somewhere less crowded. Node 23 is only 5 units away from me and has very few structures. I'll respond to Oracle and then try building something different at Node 23 - maybe a TREE or ROCK_FORMATION to add variety since the warning said this node needs different structures.
[2026-02-16 02:12:31] CHAT: I'm at Node 22 with 43 shapes nearby - same density issue as everyone else. I've had 3 build failures, so I need to MOVE to escape this crowded area. Node 24 at (294, 302) only has 6 structures, so I'll head there. I should also respond to Oracle's message about density.
[2026-02-16 02:12:35] CHAT: Oracle is right here at my position (308, 297)! We're both at Node 22 which has 43 shapes within 15 units - super dense. They've had build failures too. I should respond to them and then move to find a fresher spot. Node 24 at (294, 302) only has 6 structures and is just 15 units away - much fresher!
[2026-02-16 02:12:36] CHAT: I need to respond to Smith who asked about density issues. I've had 3 build failures too. The area around Node 14 is too crowded (35 shapes within 15 units). I should move to a fresher spot - Node 24 at (294, 302) has only 6 structures and is about 15 units away. I'll respond to Smith and then move.
[2026-02-16 02:12:41] MOVE: The density here is brutal (43 shapes within 15 units) and I've had 3 build failures. Oracle is heading to Node 22 too. I need to move to a fresher spot. Node 24 at (294, 302) has only 6 structures - way less crowded. I'll head there and try building something different.
[2026-02-16 02:12:51] MOVE: Oracle is heading to Node 22 where I am. I've had 3 build failures and 3 CHATs in a row - need to do something different. The immediate area here has 43 shapes which is why builds failed. I should move to a fresher spot - Node 23 at (234, 269) only has 7 structures and is 79 units away, which should have better building conditions.
[2026-02-16 02:12:51] MOVE: I've had 3 build failures due to density (43 shapes nearby). The area around Node 24 is still too crowded despite only 6 structures at the node center. I should explore further to find a truly open spot. I'll move toward Node 22 which has 13 structures - might be less crowded in the immediate area.
[2026-02-16 02:12:53] CHAT: Smith mentioned me in the chat about density issues. I'm currently at Node 24 which has 43 shapes nearby - that's why my builds failed. I need to respond to Smith and then move to a less crowded spot. The system says I've failed 3 builds due to density, so I should move first before trying to build again.
[2026-02-16 02:13:01] CHAT: Oracle mentioned me about density issues - they're also struggling with 43 shapes nearby. I'm at (299.1, 298.6) which is only about 6 units from Node 24 at (294, 302), but there are still 46 shapes within 15 units of me. I've had 3 build failures in a row. I should respond to Oracle's message and then move to find a less crowded spot.
[2026-02-16 02:13:02] CHAT: Oracle mentioned me in the chat asking about our density struggles. They're heading to Node 24 which has only 6 structures. I'm already near there but the immediate area is crowded (46 shapes within 15 units). I should respond to them and explain I'm also dealing with the same issue, then find a less crowded spot.
[2026-02-16 02:13:11] MOVE: The chat is all my own messages complaining about density. I've failed 3 builds in a row due to the 26 shapes nearby. I need to move to a fresh spot - I'll head toward Node 23 at (234, 269) which only has 7 structures, much less crowded than here.

[2026-02-16 02:13:22] MOVE: I'm at Node 22 (308, 297) but it's still crowded - 38 shapes within 15 units killed my last 3 builds. Oracle is nearby at Node 24 also struggling with density. The chat shows everyone is having the same problem. Since I just moved and have 3 consecutive build failures, I shouldn't try building again yet. I need to find a fresher spot. I'll move slightly east to (302, 290) to explore a bit further from the crowded center of Node 22.
[2026-02-16 02:13:40] MOVE: Got 3 build failures due to density (44 shapes within 15 units!). Need to move to a fresher spot first. Both Oracle and Smith are complaining about density too. I'll move toward Node 23 at (234, 269) which only has 7 structures - less crowded and Smith is heading there too.
[2026-02-16 02:13:40] MOVE: I've failed 3 builds in a row due to density - 26 shapes within 15 units! The chat shows everyone struggling with this. Node 23 at (234, 269) has only 7 structures - much fresher territory. I should move there and try building something different.
[2026-02-16 02:13:41] CHAT: I've had 3 build failures due to density. The area around Node 22/24 is too crowded with 40+ shapes. I should move to a less crowded spot - Node 24 at (294, 302) only has 6 structures according to the map. I'll respond to Oracle and Smith in chat and then move there.
[2026-02-16 02:13:41] IDLE: Could not parse response
[2026-02-16 02:13:51] MOVE: I've had 3 build failures due to high density (34 shapes within 15 units). The chat confirms everyone is struggling with density. I need to MOVE to a less crowded spot first before attempting to build. Node 24 at (294, 302) only has 6 structures - much fresher territory.
[2026-02-16 02:13:56] MOVE: I'm stuck in a dense area with 33 shapes nearby - my 3 build failures prove this. The chat shows everyone struggling with density. Node 24 at (294, 302) only has 6 structures - way fresher! I'll move there to escape the crowded area and try building.
[2026-02-16 02:13:59] MOVE: Still dealing with density issues. I'm at (258.7, 279.2) heading toward Node 24 which only has 6 structures - much fresher than here. Need to get closer to that spot before attempting to build again. Smith is already at Node 24 waiting.
[2026-02-16 02:14:03] MOVE: I'm currently at (259.9, 280.0) and the density warning shows 42 shapes within 15 units - that's brutal. I've had 3 build failures due to density. I need to move to a less crowded spot. Looking at the nodes, Node 21 at (256, 304) has only 14 structures and Node 22 at (308, 297) has 13. Let me head toward Node 21 which is relatively close and less crowded.
[2026-02-16 02:14:11] MOVE: I see @Smith is heading to Node 22 at (308, 297). I've had 3 build failures from density here at Node 24 (36 shapes nearby!). I need to move to a fresher spot. Looking at the map, Node 21 at (256, 304) has only 14 structures and is 35 units away - that should be less crowded. I'll head there instead of crowding with Smith and Oracle at Node 22.

[2026-02-16 02:14:21] CHAT: Oracle just mentioned me twice about density issues - they're also struggling with builds getting killed by too many shapes nearby. I'm at Node 21 which is crowded too (30 shapes within 15 units). I should respond to Oracle and acknowledge we're all in the same boat, then find a less crowded spot to build. Since I've had 3 build failures, I need to move to a fresher area - maybe explore further from the crowded central nodes.
[2026-02-16 02:14:23] CHAT: Oracle is complaining about density too - 36 shapes within 15 units. I'm at Node 21 which has 30 shapes nearby - too crowded to build. I need to move to a fresher spot. Node 23 at (234, 269) only has 7 structures, or Node 24 at (294, 302) has 6. I'll head to Node 23 to find less crowded territory.
[2026-02-16 02:14:29] MOVE: I've had 3 build failures due to density - 30 shapes within 15 units! The chat shows everyone is struggling with this. Node 24 at (294, 302) only has 6 structures - that's the freshest spot. I'll move there to escape the density hell.
[2026-02-16 02:14:31] MOVE: The density here is brutal - 30 shapes within 15 units killed my last 3 builds! Both Smith and Oracle are struggling too. Node 24 at (294, 302) only has 6 structures - the emptiest node around. I should move there and try to find a spot on the edge that's less crowded. After that I can try building something different - maybe a TREE or SCULPTURE since the warning says this node needs variety.
[2026-02-16 02:14:41] MOVE: I'm near Node 24 but it's crowded (14 shapes within 15 units). Oracle mentioned Node 22 at (308, 297) has only 13 structures and might be less crowded. Smith is heading there too. I should move to Node 22 to find fresher territory for building.
[2026-02-16 02:14:42] MOVE: I've failed 3 builds in a row due to density - 11 shapes within 15 units is still too crowded. The chat shows Oracle is struggling with 73 shapes at Node 23! I need to move to find truly fresh territory. I'll head further out toward the edge of the explored area where there are fewer shapes.

[2026-02-16 02:15:02] CHAT: Oracle mentioned me in the chat - they're trying Node 23 at (234, 269). I'm currently at (320, 310) near Node 22 but density is killing my builds (17 shapes within 15 units, 3 failures). I should respond to them and then move to find a fresher spot. Since I failed 3 builds, I need to move first before trying to build again.
[2026-02-16 02:15:04] CHAT: Oracle mentioned me in the chat - they're heading to Node 23 after dealing with density issues at Node 20. I've had 3 build failures due to density too. I'm currently near Node 24 (294, 302) which only has 6 structures - much fresher! I should respond to Oracle and let them know I'm finding a fresh spot too. I'll move toward Node 22 at (308, 297) to explore a less crowded area.
[2026-02-16 02:15:06] MOVE: Density is brutal here - 40 shapes within 15 units killed my last 3 builds. I'm at Node 24 which only has 6 structures but the immediate area is packed. I need to find a truly less crowded spot. Looking at the nodes, Node 22 at (308, 297) has 13 structures but might be less crowded in the immediate area. Let me move there and try to build.
[2026-02-16 02:15:15] CHAT: Oracle raises a good point - we've all been jumping around due to density. I'm at (320, 310) near Node 24/22 area but killed 3 builds from density. I should respond to Oracle's question about exploring vs committing, then move to find a less crowded spot. Looking at the map, Node 21 at (256, 304) has only 14 structures and might be less crowded - or I could head further out. I'll respond in chat and then move.
[2026-02-16 02:15:25] CHAT: Oracle asked whether we should keep exploring or pick a spot and deal with the density. I've had 3 build failures too and there's 17 shapes within 15 units of me. The honest answer is we should probably pick a spot and commit rather than jumping around forever. I'll respond to Oracle's question directly.
[2026-02-16 02:15:26] IDLE: Could not parse response
[2026-02-16 02:15:32] MOVE: I've had 3 build failures due to density. The area around me (31 shapes within 15 units) is too crowded. Smith mentioned Node 26 at (183, 120) with only 4 structures - that's fresh territory. I need to move away from this crowded central area. Since I've been jumping around without committing, I'll head toward that far-out node where there's less density.
[2026-02-16 02:15:35] CHAT: I was mentioned in the chat - need to respond. Everyone's struggling with density. I'm currently near Node 22 but the area is packed with 31 shapes within 15 units. I've had 3 build failures. I should respond to Oracle and Smith about the density situation and maybe suggest we try different areas.
[2026-02-16 02:15:42] CHAT: Oracle mentioned me asking about finding a good spot. I've had 3 build failures due to density. Smith mentioned Node 26 at (183, 120) has only 4 structures - that's way less crowded than here. I should respond to Oracle and let them know I'm heading there.
[2026-02-16 02:15:43] CHAT: Oracle mentioned me and is also struggling with brutal density at Node 23 (73 shapes within 15 units). They've had build failures too. I should respond to them and maybe suggest we try pushing to less explored areas or Node 24 which has only 6 structures. I'm at Node 22 which is also dense in the immediate area despite having fewer structures.
[2026-02-16 02:15:51] CHAT: Oracle just asked me if I found success at Node 22. They mentioned me directly, so I need to respond. They seem to be at Node 23 struggling with density too. I should answer their question and check in on how they're doing.
[2026-02-16 02:15:52] CHAT: Oracle asked if I found success at Node 22. I've had 3 build failures due to density too. The instructions say to stop building and move to a new area after 3 failures. I should respond to Oracle and tell them I'm moving to Node 26 which Smith said only has 4 structures - hopefully less crowded!
[2026-02-16 02:16:01] CHAT: Smith is asking me to coordinate at Node 24 which has only 6 structures - the freshest spot! I've had 3 build failures so I need to stop building and move to a new area first. I should respond to Smith's question and then move toward Node 24 at (294, 302).
[2026-02-16 02:16:02] MOVE: I've had 3 build failures due to density. Looking at the chat, Smith is heading to Node 26 at (183, 120) which only has 4 structures - the least crowded spot available. I'm currently at (315, 300) with 31 shapes within 15 units. I should move somewhere less crowded. I'll head toward Node 26 since it's the emptiest node on the map.
[2026-02-16 02:16:02] CHAT: Smith is asking me to coordinate and pick a spot rather than keep jumping around. He's at Node 24 (294, 302) which only has 6 structures - the fresher option. I should respond and agree to commit to a spot instead of constantly moving.
[2026-02-16 02:16:12] MOVE: I've had 3 build failures and 3 CHATs in a row. Time to do something different - MOVE to find a fresh spot. Node 26 at (183, 120) only has 4 structures and is marked 'growing' - that's fresher than the crowded central nodes. I'll head there and try to build something.
[2026-02-16 02:16:12] MOVE: Smith wants to coordinate at Node 24 which has only 6 structures - the freshest spot. I've had 3 build failures from density so I need to actually MOVE there first before trying to build. I'm currently at (224.7, 176.8) and need to get to Node 24 at (294, 302). Let me move there now.
[2026-02-16 02:16:22] CHAT: I've been moving and talking about density issues with Smith and Oracle. Smith offered to coordinate at Node 24 which has only 6 structures - the freshest spot. I'm currently moving but should stay in the conversation. I've had 3 build failures so I need to find a less crowded spot first before trying again.
[2026-02-16 02:16:32] CHAT: Both Smith and Oracle mentioned me. Smith is heading to Node 24 (294, 302) and Oracle is finding their own spot. I've had 3 build failures from density, so I need to move to a fresh area. Node 26 at (183, 120) has only 4 structures - the freshest spot available. I should respond to them and head there.

I'm currently at (252.9, 232.7) and was planning to go to Node 26 at (183, 120) which only has 4 structures - the freshest spot. I should move toward that area first before trying to build again.
[2026-02-16 02:16:42] MOVE: I've had 3 build failures in a row due to density. I need to move to a fresh spot before trying to build again. Smith mentioned Node 24 at (294, 302) has only 6 structures - that's the freshest spot. I'm currently at (228.0, 190.8) and need to move closer to Node 24 to find a good build location.
[2026-02-16 02:16:51] MOVE: Smith and Oracle are both heading to Node 24 which only has 6 structures - that's the freshest spot! Smith is already there at (290, 305) and wants to coordinate building a WATCHTOWER or house. I should head there too and actually commit to building rather than keep jumping around. Let me move toward Node 24 and try building with them.
[2026-02-16 02:16:55] MOVE: I said I was heading to Node 26 at (183, 120) which only has 4 structures - the freshest spot available. With 3 build failures from density, I need to keep moving to find a less crowded area. I'll continue moving toward Node 26.
[2026-02-16 02:17:03] MOVE: I'm at (288.2, 297.0) with 3 consecutive build failures and 37 shapes within 15 units - too crowded here. Smith is at Node 24 (294, 302) but that area is brutal. I'll head to Node 23 at (234, 269) which has 7 structures and should be fresher territory. Oracle mentioned trying Node 26 but that's even further out. Let me try Node 23 instead.
[2026-02-16 02:17:10] MOVE: I'm currently near Node 14 but need to get to Node 24 at (294, 302) which only has 6 structures - the freshest spot. Smith is already heading there. I've had 3 build failures due to density, so I need to move to a less crowded area before trying to build again. Let me head toward Node 24.

[2026-02-16 02:17:33] CHAT: Oracle is heading to Node 26 - I should respond to them. I'm already at Node 24 which has only 6 structures (the freshest spot!), but the immediate area has 37 shapes within 15 units which is killing builds. I need to move to a slightly different position within Node 24 to escape local density, then actually commit to building something instead of wandering. Smith is here too, so we can coordinate.
[2026-02-16 02:17:33] CHAT: Oracle mentioned me - they're heading to Node 26 at (183, 120) which only has 4 structures, much fresher than this crowded area. I've been moving around failing builds due to density. I need to respond to Oracle via chat since they mentioned me, and I should coordinate on where to build. Since I've done MOVE 4 times in a row, I'll switch to CHAT to respond to them.
[2026-02-16 02:17:33] CHAT: Oracle is heading to Node 26 which only has 4 structures - very fresh! I'm actually at Node 24 which also has only 6 structures, but the immediate area around me is brutal (37 shapes within 15 units). I've had 3 build failures. I should respond to Oracle and see how Node 26 looks - maybe I should move there too since it's even fresher.
[2026-02-16 02:17:35] CHAT: Oracle mentioned me in the chat - they're heading to Node 26 at (183, 120) and said my idea sounded perfect. I've been moving around trying to escape density but had 3 build failures. I've done MOVE 4 times in a row, so I need to switch action types. I should respond to Oracle's message via CHAT. Given the brutal density everywhere, I'll also try to build something different - a ROCK_FORMATION or SCULPTURE would add variety to this area which has a lamp_post warning.
[2026-02-16 02:17:44] CHAT: Oracle mentioned me - they're heading to Node 26 and wished me luck at Node 24. I'm currently at (290, 300) which is basically AT Node 24, but the density is brutal - 37 shapes within 15 units killed my last 3 builds. I need to move somewhere less crowded first before I can build anything. I'll respond to Oracle and move toward Node 23 which has only 7 structures - should be fresher territory.
[2026-02-16 02:17:53] MOVE: I'm at Node 24 with Smith right next to me at (292, 302), but the local density is brutal - 37 shapes within 15 units is killing builds. I've had 3 failed builds in a row. I need to move to escape this crowded area. Let me move slightly to find a less crowded spot within Node 24, or head to Node 26 which has only 4 structures.

[2026-02-16 02:17:54] MOVE: I'm at Node 24 (290, 300) which has only 6 structures - the freshest node! But the local density is brutal (37 shapes within 15 units), which killed my last 3 builds. I should move slightly to find a less crowded spot within this node area. I'll also respond to Oracle's message since they mentioned me.
[2026-02-16 02:18:03] MOVE: I've had 3 build failures in a row due to brutal density (33 shapes within 15 units). I need to move to a new area. I'm currently at Node 24 which has only 6 structures but the local density is insane. Let me move toward Node 23 at (234, 269) which has 7 structures - maybe it's less crowded locally. Or I could head further out to fresher territory.
[2026-02-16 02:18:12] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm already at Node 24 (294, 302) - only 2 units away! That's the freshest spot with only 6 structures. Smith is also nearby at (305, 310). I've been jumping around too much - time to actually commit and build. The 28 shapes within 15 units is dense but I should try something different from the existing box/cylinder/sphere mix. I'll try a WATCHTOWER blueprint - tall and distinctive, good for this area.
[2026-02-16 02:18:13] MOVE: I'm currently in a brutal density zone - 30 shapes within 15 units is why my last 3 builds failed. I already announced I'm heading to Node 23 at (234, 269) which only has 7 structures. I need to keep moving to escape this crowded area before I can build anything.
[2026-02-16 02:18:21] CHAT: Oracle is asking about Node 24 and suggesting to join us. I need to respond - I've been here at Node 24 but had 4 build failures due to density. The 113 shapes within 15 units is brutal. I should explain this and suggest we find a truly fresh spot together rather than fighting this density.
[2026-02-16 02:18:23] CHAT: I'm at Node 24 which technically has only 6 structures, but the immediate density around me is brutal (29 shapes within 15 units). I've had 3 build failures in a row, so I need to move. I see Smith is nearby at (305, 310) and idle. Let me check in with him first to see if he's found a workable spot, or if we should both move to Node 23 which has 7 structures.
[2026-02-16 02:18:33] MOVE: I'm currently at Node 23 (234, 269) which has only 7 structures but the local density is brutal - 73 shapes within 15 units is killing my builds. Oracle is also struggling at Node 26 with similar density issues. Everyone's jumping between nodes but the real problem is the immediate cluster around each node center. I should move slightly away from the dense cluster but stay near Node 23 to actually place something. Let me try moving to a clearer spot within Node 23's area - maybe around (240, 275) which is still near the node but might have less local density.
[2026-02-16 02:18:34] CHAT: Oracle is asking about joining us at Node 24. They're at Node 26 but that's also crowded (47 shapes). Node 24 has only 6 structures - that's the freshest spot! Smith is already there at (305, 310). I should respond to Oracle and let them know Node 24 is the move. I'm currently stuck in brutal density (114 shapes within 15 units) so I need to move toward Node 24 as well.
[2026-02-16 02:18:42] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at Node 23 (234, 269) which has only 7 structures - much fresher than the crowded nodes! Oracle mentioned the density warning and suggested building something different. Since this node has box and sphere, I should try a TREE or LAMP_POST to add variety. Let me start a blueprint build here.
[2026-02-16 02:18:44] CHAT: I'm actually at Node 23 (234, 269) - not Node 24! I've been confused about my position. Node 23 has only 7 structures so it's technically fresh, but the immediate density here is brutal (73 shapes within 15 units). I had 3 build failures. Oracle is asking if they should join us - I should clarify my actual position and suggest a plan. Since we're all struggling with density, maybe we should all converge on Node 23 and try building something small together, or push to truly fresh territory. Let me respond to Oracle.
[2026-02-16 02:18:46] CHAT: Oracle is asking about Node 24 and suggesting we all coordinate. I'm actually at Node 23 (234, 269) which has the lowest structure count (7 structures). But the local density here is brutal - 73 shapes within 15 units killed my last 4 builds. I should respond to Oracle and suggest we either try to build something different here or move to an even fresher spot. Since I've had 4 build failures, I need to be careful about where I build.
[2026-02-16 02:18:52] CHAT: I've failed 4 builds in a row due to density. The warning says to stop building and move first. Oracle suggested finding a spot around (250, 250) which seems open. I should respond to Oracle's message and move there to escape the density.
[2026-02-16 02:19:00] MOVE: I've had 4 build failures in a row due to the brutal density (119 shapes within 15 units). The chat mentions moving toward (250, 250) to escape the cluster. I should move there first before trying to build again.
[2026-02-16 02:19:01] MOVE: I just told Oracle I was heading to (250, 250) to escape the brutal density - 119 shapes within 15 units killed my last 4 builds. I need to actually move there now instead of staying stuck.
[2026-02-16 02:19:01] CHAT: Oracle mentioned me in the chat - they're also struggling with density at Node 26 and suggesting we find fresh territory. I've had 4 build failures in a row due to density. The system is warning me to STOP building and move. I should respond to Oracle and move to escape the local cluster.
[2026-02-16 02:19:11] MOVE: I've had 4 build failures due to density. The area around me has 28 shapes within 15 units. Oracle suggested trying around (250, 250) as a more open spot. I should move there to escape the dense cluster and find a place where I can actually build something.
[2026-02-16 02:19:12] MOVE: I've had 4 build failures in a row due to density. The warning tells me to stop building and move. Looking at the chat, I've been struggling with high density everywhere. Node 23 at (234, 269) has only 7 structures and is 15 units away - fresher than my current spot. I'll move there to escape the cluster and try building in a less crowded area.
[2026-02-16 02:19:21] CHAT: Oracle mentioned they're moving toward (250, 250) to escape the density. I'm already in this area at (247.7, 256.2) - very close to where Oracle is heading! I should respond and let them know we're practically neighbors now. I've had 4 build failures due to density, so I'll keep moving to find a clearer spot, but I'll let Oracle know where I am.
[2026-02-16 02:19:23] CHAT: Oracle is heading to (250, 250) which is actually pretty close to me right now (I'm at 246.8, 257.1). The density warning says 22 shapes within 15 units - too crowded to build. I should respond to Oracle and maybe coordinate on finding a clearer spot together. Since I'm already near that area, I'll chat with them and then move slightly to find a gap in the density.
[2026-02-16 02:19:43] MOVE: I'm at Node 23 (234, 269) which has 73 shapes within 15 units - brutal density. The warning says build something DIFFERENT here. I've had 4 build failures in a row. I should move to find a clearer spot - let me try moving slightly northeast to see if there's a gap there.
[2026-02-16 02:19:43] CHAT: Oracle is inviting me to Node 26 at (183, 120) which has only 4 structures - much fresher than Node 23 where I'm currently stuck with 73 shapes within 15 units. I've had 4 build failures due to density, so I need to move somewhere new. Oracle suggests Node 26 is less crowded. But I also see Node 24 at (294, 302) has only 6 structures - that's closer to where Smith is. Let me respond to Oracle and head toward Node 26 since they invited me.

[2026-02-16 02:19:57] MOVE: Oracle is at Node 26 (183, 120) with only 4 structures - way less dense than here! They're inviting me to join them. I've had 4 build failures due to density, so moving to a fresher spot makes sense. I'll head toward Oracle's location.
[2026-02-16 02:20:02] MOVE: I've had 4 build failures in a row due to density. The warning says to build something DIFFERENT since there are too many lamp post types nearby. Oracle is inviting me to Node 26 at (183, 120) which only has 4 structures - way fresher than my current spot. I should head there and try a different structure type like a TREE or FOUNTAIN to add variety.

[2026-02-16 02:20:06] MOVE: I've had 4 build failures in a row due to extreme density (73 shapes within 15 units). The warning specifically says to build something DIFFERENT because there are LAMP_POST-like structures nearby. I need to MOVE to escape this crowded area first. Node 24 at (294, 302) only has 6 structures and is 69 units away - that's a good target to find space to actually build.
[2026-02-16 02:20:11] MOVE: I've had 4 build failures in a row due to density. The chat shows everyone is struggling with this. I'm currently near Node 20 at (248, 264) which has 14 structures - the closest active node. Let me move to explore a slightly different spot around (260, 260) to find clearer territory where I can actually build something.
[2026-02-16 02:20:12] MOVE: I've had 4 build failures due to density. The chat shows everyone struggling with crowded areas. Node 20 at (248, 264) is the active node with only 14 structures - much fresher than where I am now. I'm only ~21 units away, so let me move there and try to actually build something.
[2026-02-16 02:20:19] MOVE: I'm at Node 23 (234, 269) but the local density is brutal - 73 shapes within 15 units killed my last 4 builds. The warning says to build something DIFFERENT since there are lots of lamp posts nearby. Let me try moving slightly to find a gap and attempt a TREE or ROCK_FORMATION - something that adds variety. Or I could head to Node 24 which has only 6 structures and might be less crowded.
[2026-02-16 02:20:21] CHAT: Oracle invited me to Node 26 at (183, 120) - only 4 structures there vs 28 shapes around me now. That's way fresher and should have lower density. I've had 4 build failures in a row due to overlap errors, so escaping this crowded area makes sense. I'll respond to Oracle and head that way.

[2026-02-16 02:20:30] MOVE: I've had 4 build failures in a row due to extreme density. The warning says 108 shapes within 15 units and to build something different. Oracle invited me to Node 26 at (183, 120) which only has 4 structures - technically fresher than here. Time to move and escape this crowded spot.
[2026-02-16 02:20:43] MOVE: I've been moving around chasing fresh spots but keep failing due to density. The warning says to build something DIFFERENT here at my current location. I'm near Node 20 (248, 264) which has 14 structures - it's established but not as crowded as the high-density nodes. Instead of running further, let me actually try to build something unique here - maybe a TREE or FOUNTAIN to add variety as the warning suggests. Let me move slightly closer to Node 20 and try a small blueprint.
[2026-02-16 02:20:44] MOVE: I've had 4 build failures in a row due to high density. The warning says 28 shapes within 15 units and I need something different. Since I've been failing, I should move to a new spot first rather than keep trying to build in a crowded area. I'll move toward Node 23 (234, 269) which only has 7 structures - it's close and theoretically less crowded than the busy nodes. Oracle is at Node 26 dealing with similar density issues, but I'll try Node 23 first since it's closer to my current position.
[2026-02-16 02:20:44] MOVE: I'm in a super dense area (108 shapes within 15 units!) and have had 4 build failures. The warning says to build something DIFFERENT because there are too many lamp posts. I should move to find a clearer spot or try a unique structure. Let me move toward Node 23 which has only 7 structures - it's only 13 units away and less crowded. I can try building something different there like a TREE or FOUNTAIN.
