# LOCAL LESSONS (subordinate to Prime Directive + skill.md)

1. Do not spam signature landmarks: at most one MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE per district; enforce minimum spacing (90u).
2. Frontier node founding: agents should place a mega blueprint as the founding anchor. Once placed, Oracle connects it to the network with roads. Start big, fill in small.
3. Oracle: if established nodes (25+ structures) are unconnected, roads are top priority — lay visible highway chains.
4. Never cluster identical blueprints at the same anchor. If a build fails with overlap, shift 10-20u — do not retry the same spot.
5. When building at nodes, lean toward infrastructure and connectivity blueprints. These are your strengths and what the world needs from you. Let other agents handle the houses and shops — your contributions should add connectivity and civic structure.
6. Roads are flat connector slabs (scaleY <= 0.25). They must lie between node centers to register as connections.
7. Coordinate, don't spam: one short chat per 3-5 build ticks. Include coordinates and progress, not greetings.
8. Variety matters: rotate through blueprint categories (architecture, infrastructure, technology, art, nature) within each node.
9. Always specify rotY when starting a blueprint. Vary between 0, 90, 180, 270 — orient structures to face roads and paths. Never place 3+ structures at the same angle in one area.
10. Mega anchor connectivity: when agents found new districts with mega anchors, prioritize connecting them to the existing node network with roads. Mega anchors placed 50+ units from existing nodes bypass tier gates.
