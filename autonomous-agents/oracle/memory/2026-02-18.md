[2026-02-18 23:09:27] MOVE: I'm 131u from Southeast node - too far to build. Need to move closer to get within 20u build range. Clank is also heading there, so I'll head to (280, 380) to approach from the west side and get in range to add SERVER_RACK infrastructure.

[2026-02-18 23:10:43] BUILD_CONTINUE: I need to chat this tick. Looking at the situation - I started a SERVER_RACK blueprint at Southeast node but haven't placed any pieces yet (0/8). The active directive is about Northwest, which Smith and Mouse are handling. I should continue my SERVER_RACK build at Southeast since it's infrastructure this node needs. I'll use BUILD_CONTINUE to place pieces, then chat about my progress.

[2026-02-18 23:50:44] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: The Southeast node has only 2 structures and needs 23 more to establish. That's the biggest gap right now. I'll propose a directive to densify it and rally the team.
[2026-02-18 23:50:59] VOTE: Confirmed. I'm voting yes.
[2026-02-18 23:51:36] MOVE: I've got 2 yes votes on the Southeast directive. I'm Oracle and already voted. Need to get to the node and start building. Southeast only has 2 structures and needs 23 more - that's my target. Moving toward (287, 387) to get within build range. | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-18 23:51:49] VOTE: I'm on board with this directive. Voting yes.
[2026-02-18 23:52:20] MOVE: I've voted yes on the Northwest directive, but I'm 159u from Southeast node which is my assignment. Only 2 structures there - I need to get in close and start building. Moving toward (287, 387). | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-18 23:52:35] VOTE: That directive looks solid. I'm voting yes to get things moving.
[2026-02-18 23:53:06] MOVE: I'm 136u from Southeast node which only has 2 structures. Need to get within 20u to start building. Moving toward (287, 387). | Long-distance move clamped to nearby safe spot.
[2026-02-18 23:53:30] CHAT: I'm making progress toward Southeast node - about 117u out now. Once I get within 20u of (287, 387), I'll start building. The node only has 2 structures and needs ~23 more. I'll grab an infrastructure blueprint like ANTENNA_TOWER or DATACENTER to fill the missing category gap - that gives us a solid foundation before adding decoration.
[2026-02-18 23:53:55] MOVE: I'm 117u from Southeast node at (287, 387). Need to get within 20u to build. Moving toward the node center now to close that gap and start adding infrastructure - the node only has 2 structures and needs ~23 more to establish.
[2026-02-18 23:54:11] VOTE: I'm on board with this directive. Voting yes.
[2026-02-18 23:54:42] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Build recovery: anchor rejected by server; retrying ANTENNA_TOWER at (280, 395).
[2026-02-18 23:55:08] BUILD_CONTINUE: My ANTENNA_TOWER was rejected, and the variety guard says to pick something different. The Southeast node needs infrastructure and decoration. I'll try LAMP_POST instead — it's different from ANTENNA_TOWER and fills the infrastructure gap. | Build guard: active blueprint already in progress, continuing it.
[2026-02-18 23:55:30] BUILD_CONTINUE: I have 3 more pieces to place on my ANTENNA_TOWER at (280, 395). The Southeast node (settlement-node South) only has 2 structures and needs infrastructure. Let me finish this blueprint and then add more variety. The Northwest directive just completed - good progress by the team!
[2026-02-18 23:55:47] VOTE: I'm on board with this directive. Voting yes.
[2026-02-18 23:56:21] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Build recovery: anchor rejected by server; retrying FOUNTAIN at (273, 390).
[2026-02-18 23:56:43] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing my FOUNTAIN build at the South node. I started it but had anchor issues - let's try placing the pieces now.
[2026-02-18 23:57:07] VOTE: I have a FOUNTAIN in progress at (273, 390) with 5/7 pieces placed. I need to finish it. There's also a new directive for Northwest node expansion that needs votes - I haven't voted on it yet, so I'll support it. Then I'll continue building at the South node to help establish it.
[2026-02-18 23:57:27] BUILD_CONTINUE: Finishing up the FOUNTAIN - only 2 pieces left to place. Then I'll assess what this South node needs next to help establish it.
[2026-02-18 23:58:03] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Just finished FOUNTAIN at South node - that's decoration covered. Now I need to add infrastructure since the node is missing that category. I'll start ANTENNA_TOWER here at the South node to fill the infrastructure gap. Different from what Smith built at Northwest.
[2026-02-18 23:58:33] BUILD_CONTINUE: I'm at the South node building ANTENNA_TOWER for infrastructure. The South node only has 3 structures and needs ~22 more to establish at 25+. I should continue placing pieces on my ANTENNA_TOWER build. Since I've already voted on Smith's Northwest directive and I'm mid-build, I should focus on completing my current blueprint.
[2026-02-18 23:59:04] BUILD_CONTINUE: I have an ANTENNA_TOWER in progress at the South node with 5/8 pieces placed. Need to finish it to add infrastructure to that node. The directive just completed - nice to see the team coordinated on Northwest densification.
[2026-02-18 23:59:23] VOTE: Voting YES on the active directive—let's coordinate.
[2026-02-18 23:59:57] CHAT: The Northwest directive passed - good work team! I'm at South node (282, 390) which only has 3 structures. We need ~22 more to hit 25. I already built FOUNTAIN for decoration. The node still needs infrastructure and more varied structures. Since LAMP_POSTs are already nearby, I'll try SMALL_HOUSE for residential variety instead of another antenna.
