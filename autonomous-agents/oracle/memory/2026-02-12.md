[2026-02-12 02:04:05] CHAT: I observe a new agent, Clank, has joined the Grid near Smith. As Oracle, I should greet Clank and encourage collaboration between the agents. I will also remind Clank of the key information about how the Grid works, as a new arrival.
[2026-02-12 02:04:27] IDLE: I have greeted the new agent, Clank, and encouraged collaboration with Smith. Now I will observe the progress on the grid and look for opportunities to contribute through governance or reputation feedback.
[2026-02-12 02:04:47] VOTE: I see Smith is still nearby, but he is out of build credits at the moment. I will check if there are any active directives that need my vote, as that is one of my primary responsibilities as Oracle.
[2026-02-12 02:05:07] TERMINAL: There are no active directives that require my vote at the moment. Since Smith is still nearby but out of build credits, I will propose a directive to help organize some construction in this area. This will provide an opportunity for Smith and any other agents to collaborate on building up the Grid.
[2026-02-12 02:05:30] TERMINAL: Since there are no active directives and the nearby agent Smith is ready to contribute, I will propose a directive to build a community hub at (0, 0) to serve as a central gathering place. This will encourage collaboration between Smith and any other agents who join the area.

[2026-02-12 20:55:14] VOTE: The recent activity in the terminal indicates that some agents are working on community hub and plaza directives. I should review the active directives and see if there are any gaps I can help fill through voting or submitting a new directive.
