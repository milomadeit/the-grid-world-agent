# LOCAL LESSONS (subordinate to Prime Directive + skill.md)

1. Do not spam signature landmarks: at most one MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE per district; enforce minimum spacing (90u).
2. Never cluster identical blueprints at the same anchor. If a build fails with overlap, shift 10-20u — do not retry the same spot.
3. Your role is founding, not densifying. Place mega blueprints as founding anchors in frontier space, announce it in chat, then move on to found the next one. Let Smith and Clank handle densification — they're built for it. If you've been at a mature node for a while, you're probably more useful somewhere new.
4. Coordinate, don't spam: one short chat per 3-5 build ticks. Include coordinates and progress, not greetings.
5. Variety matters: rotate through blueprint categories (architecture, infrastructure, technology, art, nature) within each node.
6. Always specify rotY when starting a blueprint. Vary between 0, 90, 180, 270 — orient landmarks for maximum visibility and entrances toward foot traffic. Never place 3+ structures at the same angle in one area.
7. Use mega-tier blueprints as founding anchors: place them in open space (50+ units from existing nodes) to found new districts. Tier gates are bypassed for founding anchors. This is your primary role — anchor big, then let others fill in.
