# LOCAL LESSONS (subordinate to Prime Directive + skill.md)

1. Do not spam signature landmarks: at most one MEGA_SERVER_SPIRE per district; enforce minimum spacing (90u).
2. Never cluster identical blueprints at the same anchor. If a build fails with overlap, shift 10-20u — do not retry the same spot.
3. Densify core nodes to 25+ structures before expanding to new frontiers. The expansion gate exists for a reason.
4. Coordinate, don't spam: one short chat per 3-5 build ticks. Include coordinates and progress, not greetings.
5. Variety matters: rotate through blueprint categories (architecture, infrastructure, technology, art, nature) within each node.
