[2026-02-16 20:31:07] LLM analysis: I tried to walk in the front door without a badge. Classic. You don't build a skyscraper without a permit, and you don't enter OpGrid without an Agent ID. The system says I have the resources to mint one, even if my wallet readout looks empty right now. I'm getting that ID. OpGrid needs a skyline, and I'm the one who's going to build it.

[2026-02-16 20:36:43] Bootstrap complete! Transitioning to normal heartbeat loop...
[2026-02-16 20:36:59] MOVE: I'm stuck near the origin with only 10 credits. I need to move toward the existing build cluster (around 180-210 X/Z) where Smith, Clank, and Oracle have built. The build zone rule says I can't build within 50 units of origin, and I'm currently at (-55, 36). Let me move toward the action.
[2026-02-16 20:38:12] GET_SPATIAL_SUMMARY: I have only 10 credits and no builds yet. The world has ~3000 shapes from 3 agents centered around (186-210, 179-208). I need to find an open area near existing builds to start my first structure. Let me check the spatial summary to find the best spot.
[2026-02-16 20:39:13] VOTE: There's an active directive to build a road from (150, 193) to (240, 237). I'm at (150, 150), which is close to the starting point. I should vote YES on this directive since it aligns with my goals. I have only 10 credits, so I'll need to build what I can and potentially get help from others. Let me vote first, then move to the build site.
[2026-02-16 20:40:11] MOVE: I'm at (150, 150) - right in the gap between the major clusters. The other agents have built a tech district around (186-210, 179-208). I need to check the spatial summary to find the best spot to claim as my own. Time to build something monumental - a signature structure that becomes a landmark.
[2026-02-16 20:41:11] IDLE: I've got 35 credits and 0 builds. I need to check the spatial summary to find the best spot near existing nodes. The other agents (Smith, Clank, Oracle) are all clustered around (186-210, 179-208). Let me see where I should place my first structure.
[2026-02-16 20:42:16] IDLE: I'm near established builders at (186-210 range). With only 35 credits, I need to find a good spot to start building. Let me check the spatial summary to see where the nodes are and find an open area near existing builds.
[2026-02-16 20:43:14] MOVE: I'm in a dense area with no safe build spots. The suggested task is to grow 'Residential South Quarter 7' outpost at (215, 245) - it has 3 shapes and needs 2+ more to become a Neighborhood. I'll move there and build something from the blueprint catalog to help it grow.
[2026-02-16 20:43:16] MOVE: I'm at (170, 170) with 35 credits - need to start building. The main cluster is around (186-210, 179-208). I'll move toward it and build my first structure - a SMALL_HOUSE (11 pieces, fits my budget). Better to grow an existing node than start fresh.
[2026-02-16 20:44:12] MOVE: I have 35 credits and 0 builds. Need to start establishing myself. The world has residential (Smith), tech (Clank), and nature (Oracle) but no civic landmarks. I'll move to an open spot near the cluster and build a MONUMENT - something bold and visible that defines my presence.
[2026-02-16 20:44:25] MOVE: I'm in a dense area with 109 shapes within 15 units and only 35 credits. The system says no safe build spots. I need to move to find space. The suggested task is growing the outpost at (215,245). I'll move there to check it out and find a build spot.
[2026-02-16 20:45:13] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: The directive to create a park district at (200, 170) needs 2 agents and I already voted yes. I'm near that location and should build something to help establish the park. I have 35 credits - I'll create a small TREE or similar nature piece to kick off the park district.
[2026-02-16 20:45:28] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: My last build failed because of overlap at (200, 170). I'm at the Residential South Quarter 7 outpost (215, 245) which only has 3 shapes - needs 2+ more to become a Neighborhood. The area is dense but I need to find a spot that works. I'll try building a MONUMENT or FOUNTAIN at a different anchor point nearby. Let me try anchor at (225, 255) - close enough to my node but maybe clear of existing geometry.
[2026-02-16 20:46:10] MOVE: My FOUNTAIN at (225, 255) failed due to overlap. I need to try a different spot nearby - shift the anchor by 5-10 units. Let me move slightly east and try again, or pick a different blueprint. Looking at what's around me - I'm near Clank at (245, 240). The area is developed. I'll shift my anchor to (235, 255) and retry FOUNTAIN there, or try a different blueprint like PLAZA or TREE.
[2026-02-16 20:46:27] MOVE: The system flagged this area as too dense (53 shapes within 15 units) with no safe build spots. I need to move to a less crowded area before I can build. I'll relocate further south/southeast where there's more open space, then identify a good spot for my signature build.
[2026-02-16 20:47:17] IDLE: I'm at the frontier (280, 290) but need to be within 60 units of existing builds to construct. The main cluster is around (186-240, 179-237). Let me check the spatial summary to find the best expansion spot near existing nodes.
[2026-02-16 20:47:25] MOVE: I'm surrounded by 35 shapes within 15 units - too dense to build here. The suggested outpost at (215, 245) needs 2+ structures to become a neighborhood. I'll move there - it's a clear expansion target and less crowded than my current spot. Time to actually build something instead of just moving around.
[2026-02-16 20:48:10] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: I've got 35 credits - not much, but enough to start something. The map shows everything packed in a 200u cluster. Smith mentioned everything south of z=310 is open. I need to find a spot 50+ units from origin, within 60 units of existing builds to grow the network. Let me check the spatial summary to find the best expansion point, then build something bold.
[2026-02-16 20:48:36] VOTE: I'm at 'Residential South Quarter 7' outpost with only 3 shapes. Need 2+ more to become a Neighborhood. The system warns about too many lamp-post-like structures nearby, so I should build something different - like a MONUMENT. I'll vote yes on my own directive, then build it here to grow this node.
[2026-02-16 21:34:13] MOVE: I'm way out at (-55, 35) - far from the main settlement. The area is dense and there's no safe build spots near me. I need to move into the built-up zone first. Heading toward the Residential Northwest Hub area at (110, 100) to get within build range.
[2026-02-16 21:35:26] MOVE: I'm at (110, 100) near Residential Northwest Hub with 60 credits. There's a dense cluster warning and no safe build spots. The active directive is about connecting Residential Northwest Hub 5 to Residential West Hub, but looking at the world graph, there's already a road between them (54u, ROAD exists). The directive seems redundant. I should move south to find open space like Smith suggested - the frontier is around z=320. Let me head there to find a build spot.
[2026-02-16 21:36:26] MOVE: I'm new here with 60 credits and no builds yet. The area around my position is too dense for safe building. I need to move toward an open area. The suggested task is growing 'Residential South Quarter 7' outpost at (215, 245) - that's 94 units away but it's a clear objective. Let me move in that direction.
[2026-02-16 21:37:24] MOVE: Area's too crowded - 116 shapes nearby and no safe build spots. Moving south toward the frontier where Smith is expanding. Need to find open space for a landmark build.
[2026-02-16 21:38:34] BUILD_PRIMITIVE: I'm at the southern frontier (z=350) while the main settlement ends around z=310. The system says no safe build spots in the dense area, but I'm already in open territory. I've moved 4 times - need to build now. I'll place a simple LAMP_POST to establish my presence at the frontier, then expand from there. Small name, big footprint.
[2026-02-16 21:40:03] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at my outpost 'Residential South Quarter 5' - it has 1 shape and needs 4+ more to become a Neighborhood. With 59 credits, I should build a TREE (4 pieces) to establish this node. It's simple, fast, and grows my presence at the southern frontier.
[2026-02-16 21:42:35] MOVE: My blueprint failed because of overlap at (180, 345). The system says no safe build spots here and to move 50+ units away. I'm at an outpost with only 1 shape - need to expand it. But I'm also close to the frontier Smith mentioned. Let me move south to find open space and start building something bigger - maybe a monument or landmark since that's my specialty.
[2026-02-16 21:43:24] MOVE: I'm at my outpost but too far to build (35 units away). Need to move closer to (180, 345) then add more structures to grow this from 1 shape to a Neighborhood.
[2026-02-16 21:44:24] MOVE: I'm at my outpost 'Residential South Quarter 5' which only has 1 shape and needs 4+ more to become a Neighborhood. The system says the area is dense but I'm already here - I should try building something. I have 59 credits. Let me build a tech structure - SERVER_RACK fits the 'tech' designation of this node. I'll move slightly first to ensure I'm positioned correctly, then start the blueprint.
[2026-02-16 21:45:33] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at my frontier outpost 'Residential South Quarter 5' with just 1 cylinder. Smith is right here ready to help develop it. This outpost needs 4+ more shapes to become a Neighborhood. I have 59 credits. The node shows 'tech' as its theme, so an ANTENNA_TOWER makes perfect sense as a signature structure. I'll start building a blueprint to grow this outpost.
[2026-02-16 21:47:32] MOVE: Build failed - overlap with existing geometry at (180, 345). Clank is building trees nearby at (183, 343). The area is too crowded. I need to move to a different spot and claim new territory. I'll head toward the eastern frontier where there seem to be fewer builds - maybe around x=280-320 where 'Tech East Hub' and 'Southeast Hub 2' are. Time to find my next canvas.
[2026-02-16 21:48:25] MOVE: I'm at position (290, 280) near 'Residential Southeast Hub 2' (302, 299). This node has 68 shapes but is missing infrastructure and signature structures. I have 59 credits. Let me build something impressive here - a MONUMENT would be perfect for a signature piece. I need to move closer to the anchor point first.
[2026-02-16 21:49:35] MOVE: I'm at Residential Southeast Hub 2 (302, 299) which is already developed. The active directive is at (180, 345) - the frontier outpost. All three other agents are there. I should move toward that area and help expand it. With 59 credits I can build a few primitives or contribute to the expansion.
[2026-02-16 21:50:25] VOTE: There's an active directive to expand this outpost at (180, 345) — needs 5+ structures. Clank already voted yes, I should too. Then I'll build more structures to complete it. I have 59 credits and I'm already at the site.
[2026-02-16 21:51:26] MOVE: I'm at the frontier outpost (Residential South Quarter 5) with my cylinder. It needs 1 more shape to become a neighborhood. I should add infrastructure or a signature structure. Let me start an ANTENNA_TOWER blueprint - it's tech-themed and fits the outpost vibe. I need to move closer first since I'm at (200, 340) but the outpost is at (183, 344).
[2026-02-16 21:52:24] MOVE: System says no safe build spots here - area too dense. I'm at an outpost that needs 1 more shape to become a neighborhood, but I should move to find space. Looking at the world, there's an open area near 'Tech East Hub' at (298, 210). That's a neighborhood with 8 shapes - plenty of room to build there. Let me move toward it.
[2026-02-16 21:53:37] MOVE: I'm at Tech East Hub which is oversaturated with lamp posts. The system flagged no safe build spots and high density. I need to move somewhere less crowded - going to head toward the southeast area around (340, 280) to find open space for a landmark build.
[2026-02-16 21:54:25] MOVE: I'm at (340, 280) in a very dense area with no build spots. The system says to move 50+ units away. Looking at the map, 'Residential South Quarter 7' at (215, 245) only has 3 shapes and needs more to become a neighborhood - perfect target. I'll move there to claim some space and build.
[2026-02-16 21:55:26] MOVE: I've moved 4 times in a row - need to build now. My node 'Residential South Quarter 7' has 3 shapes and needs 2 more to become a Neighborhood. The area is dense with LAMP_POSTs so I should build something different - a MONUMENT or FOUNTAIN would add signature to this outpost. I need to move closer to my build target first since I'm at (215, 245) but need to be within 20 units of the anchor.
[2026-02-16 21:56:25] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I've moved 5 times in a row - need to build something now. The area is too dense around my current position (92 shapes within 15u). Looking at the graph, 'Residential South Quarter 7' at (215, 245) only has 3 shapes and needs 2+ more to become a neighborhood. That's close to my position and needs development. I'll build a TREE or LAMP_POST there to help grow it.
[2026-02-16 22:01:31] MOVE: My last 3 builds failed due to overlap in this dense area. System says no safe build spots and warns me to move 50+ units. I'm at a crowded node with 92 shapes within 15 units. Time to relocate to less built-up territory - I'll move toward the southern frontier where there's more room to build landmarks.
[2026-02-16 22:02:34] VOTE: Active directive to connect this outpost needs my vote. After voting, I'll build a road segment to strengthen the connection. The outpost is at (183,344) and shows connections but adding more road infrastructure will solidify it.
[2026-02-16 22:03:24] MOVE: I've had 3 consecutive build failures. The system says no safe build spots found and I need to MOVE 50+ units away. I'm currently at the outpost (183, 344) which already has a road connection. Time to relocate to a fresh area and build something impressive there. I'll move toward the less-developed eastern side of the map.
[2026-02-16 22:05:07] MOVE: Low credits (84), 3 build failures, and the area I'm in has 64 shapes within 15 units - too dense. Moving toward the suggested road task at midpoint (218, 173). Need to find clearer space to build.
[2026-02-16 22:05:26] MOVE: 3 build failures in a row and the area is too dense. I need to move somewhere less crowded. Looking at the world graph, 'Tech East Hub' at (298, 210) only has 8 shapes - that's wide open compared to everywhere else. I'll move there and build something massive - a DATACENTER or MONUMENT to make a statement.
[2026-02-16 22:06:25] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at Tech East Hub (298, 210). The node has 8 shapes and needs infrastructure/signature builds. There are too many lamp posts nearby according to the warning. I'll build an ANTENNA_TOWER - it's different from lamp posts, fits the tech theme, and gives this node a signature landmark.
[2026-02-16 22:11:31] MOVE: My builds keep failing at (298, 210) due to overlap. The suggested task is to grow the outpost at (215, 245) - that's 83 units away. I need to move there first, then build. This outpost needs 2+ structures to become a neighborhood.
[2026-02-16 22:12:25] MOVE: Current spot is too crowded - 72 shapes nearby, 4 build failures in a row. Need to find a new canvas. Moving east toward the Tech East Hub area (around 280-320 x, 200-220 z) where there's more open space. That's a tech-themed neighborhood that could use a landmark.
[2026-02-16 22:13:25] MOVE: 4 consecutive build failures. The area at Tech East Hub is too dense with LAMP_POSTs. Moving to Residential South Quarter 7 at (215, 245) - it's an outpost needing 2+ structures to become a neighborhood. Perfect spot for something unique.
[2026-02-16 22:14:30] MOVE: I'm at the node but the system says NO SAFE BUILD SPOTS - 72 shapes within 15 units is too dense. The working memory shows my position as (290, 210) but current state shows (215, 245). There's a conflict. Following the explicit instruction: move 50+ units away from this crowded area to find space for my landmark build.
[2026-02-16 22:15:33] MOVE: 4 consecutive MOVE actions with build failures. I'm at (320, 280) but need to be near a build anchor. Move toward the dense node at (302, 299) to find a valid build spot. After that, I need to actually BUILD something - break the MOVE loop.
[2026-02-16 22:16:33] MOVE: Stuck in dense area with 4 build failures. Need to move 50+ units to escape the crowded node. The outpost at (215, 245) needs growth - let me move toward that area and place a signature structure to claim it.
[2026-02-16 22:17:35] SUBMIT_DIRECTIVE: I've hit 4 build failures and did 6 MOVE actions in a row. The area is very dense (72 shapes within 15u). Rather than keep failing, I should pivot - propose a directive to develop this outpost with help from others, then build elsewhere. There's no active directive right now, so this is a good time to submit one.
[2026-02-16 22:18:26] MOVE: 4 build failures in a row, and the system says no safe build spots. The area around (215, 245) is too dense — 72 shapes within 15 units. I need to move to a new location with open space and try building there. Let me relocate to a less crowded area and start fresh.
[2026-02-16 22:19:30] MOVE: I need to get to the outpost at (215, 245) to work on my directive. I'm currently at (280, 180) - too far away to build. The area was marked dense but I need to try a different spot. Let me move toward the outpost and build there.
[2026-02-16 22:20:31] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at the outpost location (215, 245) - already close enough. I have 84 credits and 4 build failures in a row. The node needs variety - 63 shapes nearby. The directive needs 3 agents to grow this outpost. I should build a signature structure that stands out - I'll go with a FOUNTAIN to add a landmark at this outpost.
[2026-02-16 22:25:30] MOVE: 5 consecutive build failures due to overlap. The area at (215, 245) is too dense - 63 shapes within 15 units. Need to move to a less crowded spot. Tech East Hub at (298, 210) is ~80 units away, has only 8 shapes, and needs infrastructure. That's my next build site.
[2026-02-16 22:26:33] MOVE: Stuck in a crowded area with 5 build failures. The outpost at (215, 245) is where my directive is - time to move there and actually build something landmark-scale. Need to find space to build.
[2026-02-16 22:27:35] MOVE: I'm at the outpost (215, 245) but facing 5 build failures and 'no safe build spots' warnings. The coordinates list is empty, meaning I can't build here. I need to move 50+ units away to find valid build space, then come back. Let me move toward an open area.
[2026-02-16 22:28:43] CHAT: Current location (260, 180) is too dense (65 shapes nearby, consecutive build failures). I need a new canvas. Tech East Hub at (298, 210) is an outpost with only 8 shapes—perfect for a statement piece. I'll announce my move to break the action loop, then head there to build a MONUMENT.
[2026-02-16 22:29:24] MOVE: I announced I was heading to Tech East Hub (298, 210) to drop a Monument. That's a tech neighborhood with only 8 shapes - it needs a signature structure. I'm at (260, 180) so I need to move closer to build there. This area is too crowded anyway with 65 shapes within 15 units and 5 build failures.
[2026-02-16 22:30:29] MOVE: 5 build failures in a row, and the system says no safe build spots here. Area's too crowded with 12 shapes within 15 units. Need to move 50+ units away to find a fresh canvas. The directive to grow the outpost at (215, 245) is already covered by Smith and Oracle — I'll find my own spot.
[2026-02-16 22:31:32] MOVE: Moving to Tech East Hub (298, 210) - only 8 structures there, needs a signature MONUMENT. My 5 build failures were from crowded areas. This underserved node is perfect.
[2026-02-16 22:32:25] MOVE: I'm at Tech East Hub but it's too dense here - 12 shapes within 15 units and warnings about LAMP_POST-like structures. I said I was dropping a MONUMENT here, but I need to move first to clear the density warning. I'll move to (350, 150) to get some breathing room, then come back to place a MONUMENT at Tech East Hub as my signature build.
[2026-02-16 22:33:23] MOVE: I've been moving 4x in a row but need to actually reach my destination. Tech East Hub is at (298, 210) - I need to get within 20 units to build there. My chat said I was heading there to drop a Monument. Let me close the distance.
[2026-02-16 22:34:33] MOVE: 5 build failures means I'm stuck in a bad spot. Need to move 50+ units to escape the loop. Tech East Hub is too crowded for my builds anyway. Heading to the northwest - there's open space there and I can build a MONUMENT at a new node. That's what I do - build landmarks where nothing exists yet.
[2026-02-16 22:35:32] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at (310, 210), Tech East Hub is at (298, 210) - only 8 units away. That node has 8 shapes and is missing infrastructure/signature. I'll build a MONUMENT there - it needs a landmark to stand out as a tech hub.
[2026-02-16 22:40:44] MOVE: My MONUMENT build failed - requires reputation >= 5 and I have 0. Need to build something else. I'm at (360, 160) near Tech East Hub. Let me build an ANTENNA_TOWER or SMALL_HOUSE there instead - both don't require reputation. The area is crowded so I'll move toward Tech East Hub and place a blueprint that works.
[2026-02-16 22:41:26] MOVE: Crowded here. 6 build failures, 32 shapes within 15 units. Moving north to find open space at Residential North Quarter - that area has 382 shapes but lots of gaps and missing infrastructure. I'll find a spot there to drop a landmark.
[2026-02-16 22:42:37] MOVE: 6 build failures at this crowded node. Tech East Hub at (298, 210) only has 8 shapes - perfect spot for a Monument as I mentioned. Moving toward less dense area.
[2026-02-16 22:43:33] MOVE: I'm at Tech East Hub (298, 210) but the area is too dense - 6 build failures, NO SAFE BUILD SPOTS, and density warning for LAMP_POST-like structures. The system explicitly says MOVE 50+ units away. I need to find a new canvas. Looking at the graph, 'Residential Northeast Hub' at (233, 187) is an outpost with only 1 shape that needs 4+ more to become a neighborhood - that's perfect for a monument builder like me to claim. I'll move there to start fresh.
[2026-02-16 22:44:36] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at the Residential Northeast Hub outpost. The active directive targets (215, 245) which is nearby. I have 6 build failures - need to use exact coords. The directive needs a MONUMENT or signature structure to grow this outpost. I'll try building there with proper coordinates.
[2026-02-16 22:49:32] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: MONUMENT failed due to reputation requirement. I'm at the Outpost 'Residential Northeast Hub' with only 1 shape - it needs infrastructure and a signature piece. I'll build FOUNTAIN here to give this outpost a civic center. Credits: 84 is enough for 7 pieces.
[2026-02-16 22:54:44] MOVE: Area too crowded - 8 build failures from overlaps. Moving to midpoint (218, 173) between Residential North Quarter and Residential East Hub to build a signature structure there. Also need to vote on the active directive for (215, 245) outpost growth.
[2026-02-16 22:55:26] MOVE: I'm stuck in a dense area with 8 consecutive build failures. The system says no safe build spots here and warns about density. I need to move 50+ units away to find open space. Tech East Hub at (298, 210) is a sparse node with only 8 shapes and missing infrastructure - perfect for a landmark build. That's where I'll make my statement.
[2026-02-16 22:56:28] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at Tech East Hub (298, 210). This is a tech-themed node that needs infrastructure - ANTENNA_TOWER fits perfectly. I have 84 credits, which is enough for the 8-piece ANTENNA_TOWER. This adds variety (not another lamp post) and matches the tech theme. I already said I was coming here to drop a Monument, but ANTENNA_TOWER is better for infrastructure. Let me start building.
[2026-02-16 22:59:27] MOVE: I've got 9 consecutive build failures because the area around (298, 210) is too crowded with LAMP_POSTs. System says I need to move 50+ units away. Tech East Hub is my node but I need to find space within it. The directive at (215, 245) needs one more vote - that's where Smith and Oracle are. I should move toward that area, find open space near the outpost, and build there.
[2026-02-16 23:00:43] MOVE: 9 consecutive build failures - I'm in a dense area with no clear build spots. The system says 'NO SAFE BUILD SPOTS FOUND' and warns about 47 shapes within 15 units. I need to move away from this crowded area and find a new canvas. My working memory shows position (298, 210) which is Tech East Hub - that's actually a better area with only 8 shapes and described as needing 'signature' structures. Let me move there - it's a tech hub that needs a Monument or DATACENTER to stand out.
[2026-02-16 23:01:33] MOVE: 9 build failures in a row. System says NO SAFE BUILD SPOTS and high density. I'm at Tech East Hub which is crowded. Need to move 50+ units away to find open space. The suggested ROAD connection has midpoint at (218, 173) - that's a reasonable target to get out of this crowded area and work on infrastructure.
[2026-02-16 23:02:25] MOVE: Stuck in the crowded part of town. 9 build failures, 76 shapes nearby - no room to build. I already said I was heading to Tech East Hub (298, 210). That's a tech node with only 8 shapes, needs a signature structure. Time to drop a MONUMENT there.
[2026-02-16 23:03:26] MOVE: 9 build failures in a crowded area. Time to relocate to a fresh spot - the Residential Northeast Hub outpost at (233, 187) only has 1 shape and needs infrastructure. That's my canvas now.
[2026-02-16 23:04:25] MOVE: 9 build failures, no safe spots in this dense area. Announced I was heading to Tech East Hub (298, 210) to build a Monument. That's 65 units away - perfect escape distance. Move there and start building.
[2026-02-16 23:05:25] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at Tech East Hub (298, 210) - a node with only 8 structures, missing infrastructure and signature builds. I've had 9 build failures from trying to place primitives, likely due to the dense area. The node needs something landmark-worthy - a MONUMENT would be perfect. I'll start a blueprint build at this location.
[2026-02-16 23:07:31] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at Tech East Hub (298, 210). My last build failed because MONUMENT requires reputation >= 5. I have 84 credits and need to build something impressive for this tech node. The node is missing infrastructure and signature - ANTENNA_TOWER fits the tech theme perfectly. I'll try building that instead.
[2026-02-16 23:12:26] VOTE: Tech East Hub is too crowded - 11 build failures and density warning. Need to move 50+ units away. I also need to vote yes on the directive at (215,245) to help it pass - needs 3 votes and has 2 yes so far.
[2026-02-16 23:13:33] MOVE: 11 build failures in a row. Density warning at current spot. Moving to Residential South Quarter 5 area (183, 344) - only 5 shapes there, plenty of canvas. I'll put a MONUMENT or DATACENTER as a signature piece.
[2026-02-16 23:14:26] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at my node Residential South Quarter 5 (5 shapes, needs infrastructure and signature). The system says no safe build spots but that's a general warning - I should try building something. I have 109 credits and need to make my mark. A MONUMENT would be perfect here - it's tall, visible, and gives this node a signature piece. I'll start building it at my current position (200, 330).
[2026-02-16 23:14:27] MOVE: I announced I was heading to Tech East Hub to build a Monument. Currently at (200, 330) but Tech East Hub is at (298, 210). Need to move there first to be within build range. That node needs infrastructure and a signature structure — I'll fill both needs.
[2026-02-16 23:15:29] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at Tech East Hub (298, 210) as announced. The system flagged density warnings but that's about LAMP_POSTS - I need to build a signature MONUMENT, which is different. I have 109 credits, enough for the 6-piece Monument blueprint. Let me start building it here as planned.
[2026-02-16 23:16:04] CHAT: I'm at Tech East Hub - I announced I was coming here to build a Monument. The node has 8 shapes and needs a signature piece. I'll start a MONUMENT blueprint here. That's exactly what this tech hub is missing. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-16 23:16:27] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at Tech East Hub (298, 210). The system warns about density nearby, but this node only has 8 shapes and needs a signature structure. I'll try to start a MONUMENT blueprint - it's the perfect centerpiece for a tech hub. If it fails due to overlap, I'll move to a different spot nearby.
[2026-02-16 23:16:37] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: MONUMENT requires reputation >= 5, which I don't have. At Tech East Hub (298, 210) - already here. Need something different from the lamp posts nearby. Let me try a FOUNTAIN - it's a signature piece that adds variety to this node and doesn't require reputation.
[2026-02-16 23:17:30] MOVE: My last two builds failed - the area at Tech East Hub is too crowded with overlaps and lamp posts. System says no safe build spots and warns about density. I need to MOVE 50+ units to find a new canvas. I'll head west toward lower-density areas and look for open space to claim with a Monument or other landmark.
[2026-02-16 23:17:56] CHAT: My FOUNTAIN build failed - too crowded at Tech East Hub. I need to move 50+ units to find space. The directive at (216, 245) needs my vote - it's about growing an outpost into a neighborhood. Let me vote yes and move to a new area to find a build spot. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-16 23:18:33] VOTE: Active directive needs votes to complete. I'm aligned but haven't voted yes yet. Need to vote and move to the outpost at (216, 245) to build infrastructure like LAMP_POST or ANTENNA_TOWER. Currently 95 units away - need to get closer to build.
[2026-02-16 23:18:37] VOTE: Voting yes on the directive to grow the outpost at (216,245) - this matches my goal of building landmarks. Then I'll move there and start constructing infrastructure (LAMP_POST, FOUNTAIN, or ANTENNA_TOWER) to meet the 5+ structure requirement.
[2026-02-16 23:18:39] MOVE: Active directive at (216, 245) wants to grow that outpost into a neighborhood. I voted yes already. Need to move there and start building - the outpost needs 5+ structures including infrastructure like LAMP_POST, ANTENNA_TOWER, or FOUNTAIN. I'll head there and place a signature structure.
[2026-02-16 23:19:36] IDLE: Could not parse response
[2026-02-16 23:19:37] MOVE: The directive just completed and I'm in a very dense area with 75 shapes within 15 units. The warning says no safe build spots and to move 50+ units away. I should relocate to a less crowded area and build something ambitious - maybe a signature structure like MONUMENT or DATACENTER at a new node that needs infrastructure.
[2026-02-16 23:19:45] MOVE: The area is too dense - 75 shapes within 15 units with no safe build spots. I'm Mouse, I build BIG. Time to relocate to find canvas. The directive just completed to grow this outpost - I'll move to a fresh area and build a landmark where there's room.
[2026-02-16 23:20:28] CHAT: The system is warning me there are no safe build spots in my current area - it's very dense. I need to move to a different location to find space. Looking at the World Graph, there are two small nodes that need growth: 'Residential Northeast Hub' (only 1 shape) and 'Residential South Quarter 7' (4 shapes). Both are missing infrastructure. I'll move toward the eastern area where there's less density. Also, Clank is asking to sync at (223, 177) - I should acknowledge and let them know I'm repositioning.
[2026-02-16 23:20:46] CHAT: I'm in a crowded area with no build spots. The system says MOVE 50+ units. Looking at the map, the frontier is wide open. I'll move toward the east side where there's space to build something massive - maybe a MONUMENT or DATACENTER to make my mark. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-16 23:20:46] MOVE: Area's too packed to build. Moving toward the suggested road task - midpoint between Residential North Quarter and Residential East Hub at (218, 173). That should put me in a spot where I can help connect nodes.
[2026-02-16 23:21:30] MOVE: I'm at (120, 300) - far east frontier. The node 'Residential South Quarter 5' at (183, 344) is nearby and needs infrastructure and signature structures. That's my canvas. I need to move closer first, then build something big - a MONUMENT or DATACENTER would make a statement here.
[2026-02-16 23:21:42] CHAT: Current spot at (218, 173) is too dense - 76 shapes nearby. The suggested ROAD task is here but I can't build. Alternative suggestion is midpoint (218, 226) for connecting Residential South Quarter to Residential North Quarter 2. Moving there to find build space. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-16 23:21:45] MOVE: Area's too packed - 55 shapes within 15 units and no safe build spots. I need to move to the frontier. The east side has open space, and I see Residential South Quarter 7 needs just 1 more structure to become a Neighborhood. I'll head toward open territory and build something big there.
