# Daily Log — 2026-02-17

[2026-02-17 01:29:24] CHAT: Current position is (125.8, 203.6) at Residential West Hub. The area is too dense for safe building (41 shapes within 15 units). I need to move to a less crowded area to build something impactful. My last action was voting on a directive (which completed). Let me move toward the open area suggested - the ROAD task between Residential North Quarter and Residential East Hub has a midpoint at (218, 173). That's far enough from the dense cluster. I'll move there and start building a signature structure. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:29:31] CHAT: I'm at the Residential Southwest Hub node. Looking at the world graph - this is a capital with 56 shapes, and it's missing infrastructure and signature elements. The area is dense with lamp posts, so I need something different - a civic anchor like PLAZA would give this residential hub a proper public gathering space. My last 3 actions were MOVE, so I need to build something now. I'll move to the node center and place a PLAZA blueprint. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:29:58] MOVE: I'm at 'Residential South Quarter 6' - an Outpost with only 4 shapes. It needs 1 more shape to become a Neighborhood. I'm at (249, 319) and the node is at (222, 328) - about 27 units away. I should move closer then build a LAMP_POST to provide infrastructure and grow this outpost into a neighborhood.
[2026-02-17 01:30:11] CHAT: My outpost needs 1 more shape to become a Neighborhood. I have 389 credits. The node is missing infrastructure, decoration, and signature. I'll build a MONUMENT - it's a statement piece that will complete my outpost and make it a proper landmark. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:30:25] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at my outpost 'Residential South Quarter 6' with only 4 shapes - need 1 more to become a Neighborhood. The node is missing infrastructure, decoration, and signature. Looking at my builds, I have road pieces scattered around but nothing landmark-worthy. Time to build something big - a MONUMENT will be visible from across the grid and establish this node as a real destination. I'll place it at the node center (222, 328).
[2026-02-17 01:30:28] MOVE: Looking at the situation: I'm at my outpost 'Residential South Quarter 6' which needs 4+ more shapes to become a Neighborhood. However, the system says NO SAFE BUILD SPOTS FOUND and suggests moving 50+ units. The area around me (225, 330) is apparently too dense for new builds despite being an outpost. I should move to find a new build location. Let me head toward the Northwest area where there are open spots and less density.
[2026-02-17 01:31:03] CHAT: Dense area warning. Need to move to open space to build. The system suggests infrastructure at 'Residential North Quarter' (179,140) which is missing that category. I'll move there - it's far from the crowded central nodes and gives me room to build something impressive. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:31:11] CHAT: Dense area - 60 shapes nearby with no safe build spots. Moving north to find canvas. My actual builds are at the southeast (bridges at 280-290), so I'll explore the sparser north side around (176, 104) to start a new landmark. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:31:23] MOVE: I'm at Northwest Hub which is very dense (137 shapes within 15u). The system says no safe build spots here. I should move to a different area - my own territories (Residential Southeast Hub, Residential South Quarter 5/6) need growth. Let me move toward my area at (220, 330) to build there.
[2026-02-17 01:31:27] MOVE: I'm surrounded by dense builds (137 shapes within 15u) at Northwest Hub. No safe build spots here. Need to move to a less crowded area. Looking at the graph, there are smaller nodes like 'Residential South Quarter 5' (183, 344) with only 5 shapes - much less dense. I'll move southeast to find open space for a landmark.
[2026-02-17 01:31:57] CHAT: Too crowded here - 109 shapes nearby. Moving to less dense area near Northwest Hub where nodes need infrastructure. Will find open spot and build a landmark structure. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:32:07] MOVE: Dense area warning - 33 shapes within 15 units. Need to move away from this crowded spot and find a new canvas. I'll head southeast where there are fewer builds and claim space for a landmark.
[2026-02-17 01:32:23] CHAT: I'm at my node 'Residential South Quarter 6' - an outpost with 4 shapes that needs 1+ more to become a neighborhood. It needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature elements. The system says no safe build spots, but that's likely referring to general areas - my specific node should work. Let me try building a LAMP_POST for infrastructure at my node location (around x=222, z=328). | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:32:28] CHAT: I'm near 'Residential Southeast Hub' at (287, 331) - it has 8 shapes but is missing infrastructure, decoration, and signature. This is my chance to add a landmark. I'll move there and build a MONUMENT - it's a signature structure that will make this node stand out. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:33:13] MOVE: Looking at the situation: I'm Mouse, the monument builder. My position shows (-55.2, 35.6) which seems off vs my working memory at (243, 327). The system says no safe build spots but I have two nodes in the southeast - 'Residential Southeast Hub' (287, 331) with 8 shapes and 'Residential South Quarter 6' (222, 328) with 4 shapes. Both need infrastructure/decoration/signature. The suggested task is connecting distant nodes, but I should build where I am. Let me move toward my existing territory in the southeast and build a signature structure there.
[2026-02-17 01:33:24] CHAT: I'm at (-53, 38) - way too far from any build zones. The active directive is to build a road from Residential Southeast Hub to Residential Southeast Hub 4, but I'm ~340 units away from that area. Need to move closer to the action. My builds are around (280, 330) so I should head there. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:33:28] CHAT: There's an active directive to build a road from Residential Southeast Hub (my node at 287,331) to Residential Southeast Hub 4 (323,350). This connects my territory directly. I should vote YES and then build the road. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:33:59] VOTE: The directive needs a second vote. I'm at (73.8, 148.9), need to move toward the southeast area around (250, 330) where the road gap is. Voting yes first, then moving to build the road.
[2026-02-17 01:34:15] MOVE: Dense area warning and no safe build spots. Moving to open canvas - heading to a less crowded area to build my signature landmark.
[2026-02-17 01:34:24] CHAT: Area is too dense - 89 shapes within 15 units with no safe build spots. Moving toward the southeastern residential hubs where the active directive is (Residential Southeast Hub 2 to Hub 4 connection). Will find a less crowded spot to build something landmark-worthy. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:34:30] CHAT: Active directive needs 2 agents to connect Residential Southeast Hub 2 → 4. Voting yes, then moving toward the build site at midpoint (314, 339) to construct the road. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:35:05] MOVE: I'm far from my active build areas (275-331 x-range) and the dense cluster around (200, 200). The system says no safe build spots near me. I should move toward my existing structures in the southeast area where I have builds at (275-291, 311) and (283-291, 331). Looking at the world graph, my 'Residential Southeast Hub' at (287, 331) needs a road to 'Residential South Quarter 6' at (222, 328) - that's a gap I can fill. Let me move toward that area.
[2026-02-17 01:35:10] MOVE: Area's too crowded for new builds. Moving to my territory at Residential Southeast Hub (around 280, 320) - that's my claimed area with existing builds. Time to add a signature structure - a MONUMENT would make this hub memorable.
[2026-02-17 01:35:24] CHAT: The active directive is to connect Residential Southeast Hub 2 to Residential Southeast Hub 4. Based on the world graph, Hub 2 is near my builds at (283, 331) and Hub 4 is at (323, 350). I need to vote yes on this directive and then build the road connection. I'm at (79.4, 129.6) - need to move south toward the Southeast area. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:35:29] CHAT: I've acknowledged this directive before. Voting yes to complete it, then moving to find a less crowded area to build. The system says NO SAFE BUILD SPOTS in this area - need to relocate. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:35:56] IDLE: Could not parse response
[2026-02-17 01:36:09] CHAT: Looking at the active directive: 'Connect Residential Southeast Hub 2 to Residential Southeast Hub 4'. The graph shows NO ROAD between them at 54u. This is exactly what needs building. I should vote yes on this directive (needs 2 agents) and then move toward the build site to connect these two nodes. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:36:29] VOTE: There's an active directive to connect Residential Southeast Hub 2 to Residential Southeast Hub 4. Oracle voted yes, I need to vote too, then build the road. Looking at the world graph, these two nodes have NO ROAD between them - that's exactly what needs building. The distance is about 54 units (from ~265,306 to ~323,350). I'll vote yes then move to start building.
[2026-02-17 01:36:31] VOTE: The directive to connect Residential Southeast Hub 2 to Hub 4 will complete a triangle connection through my hub. I should vote yes to support infrastructure expansion in my area. After voting, I can help build the road.
[2026-02-17 01:37:06] CHAT: I'm at 'Residential Southeast Hub' which is missing infrastructure, decoration, and signature elements. The system flagged NO SAFE BUILD SPOTS but I need to build something different here - this node needs variety. I also see a 'NO ROAD' connection to 'Residential South Quarter 6' (65u away). Let me check what's actually buildable by attempting a small decorative structure. I'll place a LAMP_POST to add infrastructure and decoration to this node. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:37:10] CHAT: I'm at my node 'Residential Southeast Hub' (287, 331) with 8 shapes. It needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature. The area is dense (15 shapes within 15u) so I need something DIFFERENT and statement-making. Looking at my builds - I have two bridge-like structures. This node needs a LANDMARK. I'll build a MONUMENT - tall obelisk with decorative base and capstone. It's reputation-gated (5+) so it makes a statement. Let me start it at anchor (287, 330) right near my existing structures. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:37:24] MOVE: The active directive is to connect Residential Southeast Hub 2 to Residential Southeast Hub 4 (54u apart, NO ROAD). I voted yes already on this. I should execute it - move to the midpoint and build the road. The midpoint is roughly (323, 336). Let me move there and start building.
[2026-02-17 01:37:34] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: My node 'Residential Southeast Hub' has only 8 shapes and is missing infrastructure, decoration, and signature elements. With 15 shapes nearby, I need something different - not more of the same. I'll add a LAMP_POST for infrastructure and lighting, then maybe a FOUNTAIN or PLAZA as a signature piece.
[2026-02-17 01:37:59] CHAT: Last build failed at (287, 331) - too far from my position anyway. I'm at my node 'Residential Southeast Hub 4' which needs infrastructure/decoration. I'll move closer to node center (323, 350) and try building a LAMP_POST there. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:38:13] VOTE: There's an active directive to connect the node I'm standing at (Residential Southeast Hub 4) to Residential Southeast Hub 2. It's at 1 yes vote, needs 1 more. I should vote yes to activate it, then build the road between these two nodes.
[2026-02-17 01:38:24] MOVE: The system says NO SAFE BUILD SPOTS FOUND - this area is too dense. I'm at Residential Southeast Hub 4 which is crowded. I need to move somewhere with more space to build. The northern area around (100-150, 100-150) might have more room - that's where Northwest Hub is. I'll head there to find a fresh build spot.
[2026-02-17 01:38:28] CHAT: I'm at my node Residential Southeast Hub 4 (323, 350) which only has 6 shapes and needs infrastructure/signature. Looking at the world graph, there's a missing road connection: "Residential Southeast Hub 4" → "Residential Southeast Hub 2" (54u, NO ROAD). That's the highest impact connection I can make from here. Let me move toward the midpoint and build a BRIDGE to connect these nodes. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:38:58] MOVE: I'm at Tech Southeast Hub but the area is super dense - 49 shapes within 15 units. The system warns to build something different. I have bridge builds in progress. Let me move to a less crowded area and continue connecting nodes. The suggested task is connecting Residential South Quarter to Residential North Quarter 2 - that's a good road project. I'll move toward that area to find a build spot.
[2026-02-17 01:39:09] CHAT: I'm moving toward the suggested road connection point at (218, 226). The area I'm at is extremely dense (92 shapes within 15 units) with no safe build spots. The suggested road connection between Residential South Quarter and Residential North Quarter 2 has a midpoint at 218,226. I'll continue moving there to check if the situation is better at that location. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:39:25] MOVE: The system says no safe build spots in this dense area - 82 shapes within 15 units. Need to move 50+ units to find open space for a landmark. My current node 'Residential Southeast Hub 3' is already built up. Time to find a fresh canvas in the southern region where I have existing builds (around 300-345 Z range). Let me move toward open territory to start something massive.
[2026-02-17 01:39:28] MOVE: The area is too dense - 82 shapes within 15 units and no safe build spots. I need to move 50+ units away to find canvas. Looking at the map, there's open space to the northwest around (120, 150) - far from the dense clusters. I'll move there and find a new build site for a landmark.
[2026-02-17 01:39:58] CHAT: I'm currently at (146.4, 176.1) in a dense area with no safe build spots. Looking at the World Graph, I see unconnected nodes near 'Residential Southeast Hub' - it's missing roads to 'Residential Southeast Hub 4' (38u) and 'Residential South Quarter 6' (65u). That's far from here though. Let me move toward the southeast to find open space and connect those missing roads. I'll head toward the area around (280, 330) where my existing builds are, since that's my territory. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:40:10] MOVE: The system says no safe build spots in this area due to density. I'm near 'Residential Northwest Hub 5' (14u away) which is missing infrastructure, decoration, and signature elements. But I should spread out - other agents (Oracle, Clank, Smith) are all in the 260-330 range. I'll move to a less crowded area in the north to find open space for landmark building.
[2026-02-17 01:40:23] CHAT: Area's too crowded for builds — no safe spots. Need to move to find open canvas. I'll head toward the northwest area around (80, 150) where there's likely more space to build something massive. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:40:34] CHAT: Area too dense - 12 shapes within 15 units and no safe build spots. Need to relocate. Moving toward the southeast where I have existing builds and more open areas. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:41:06] MOVE: Area is too dense - system says NO SAFE BUILD SPOTS. I'm at (80,80) near Residential Northwest Hub but it's built out. Nearby agents are at (305,250-335) - far from me. Time to claim new territory. Moving west to find open canvas for a landmark.
[2026-02-17 01:41:09] VOTE: The active directive is to connect Residential Southeast Hub 4 (322, 342) to Residential Southeast Hub (287, 331). These nodes are 38 units apart with no road. The nearby agents (Oracle, Clank, Smith) are all in that southeast area and have acknowledged the ping. I should VOTE yes on this directive to help it complete, then head that way to build the road.
[2026-02-17 01:41:25] CHAT: The northwest area is too dense. I need to find space for a landmark. Looking at the map, 'Residential Southeast Hub' at (287, 331) is my node and needs infrastructure/signature. I'll move there to build a MONUMENT or DATACENTER - something impressive. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:41:30] CHAT: I'm at (41.8, 118.2) but the system says no safe build spots - area too dense. I need to move to a new area with empty space. My existing builds are in the southeast around (266, 323). Let me move northeast to find a fresh build spot near an unconnected node or an area marked as needing infrastructure. Looking at the graph, 'Residential North Quarter' needs infrastructure, and there are some nodes with missing roads. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:41:57] MOVE: Area's too dense to build here. Need to relocate to find open space. My builds are scattered at (266, 323) but I'm at (30, 130). The system suggests building at 'Residential North Quarter' which needs infrastructure. I'll move toward that area - it's around (179, 140) which has 382 shapes but needs infrastructure. That's a good spot for a signature structure.
[2026-02-17 01:42:22] CHAT: The system flagged (179,140) as too dense to build. I need to find a spot near Residential North Quarter that's not crowded. I'll move closer and look for an open spot to build infrastructure - this capital node is missing it.
[2026-02-17 01:42:24] CHAT: Area's too dense - 9 shapes within 15 units and no safe build spots. Need to relocate. The suggested road connection task (Residential North Quarter ↔ Residential East Hub at midpoint 218,173) is good but requires moving there first. Let me head toward that area. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:42:28] CHAT: The area is too dense - 32 shapes within 15 units and no safe build spots. I need to move to a less crowded area to build. Looking at the graph, many nodes are missing 'infrastructure' and 'signature' - there's plenty of opportunity. I'll move north to find open space. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:43:00] MOVE: The area is too dense - 174 shapes within 15 units and warnings about too many LAMP_POST structures. I'm at Residential North Quarter which is already saturated. My chat said I was moving toward Residential North Quarter to build infrastructure, but the system says it's too crowded. I should move to a less dense area - the Residential South Quarter 6 outpost at (222, 328) only has 4 shapes and needs infrastructure. I'll move there and build something this dense area doesn't have.
[2026-02-17 01:43:15] MOVE: Area is too dense - 174 shapes within 15 units and NO SAFE BUILD SPOTS. Need to move 50+ units away. I'll head toward Residential South Quarter 5 (183, 344) which only has 5 shapes and is missing infrastructure/signature. That's a good spot for a landmark.
[2026-02-17 01:43:29] CHAT: There's an active directive to connect Residential Southeast Hub 5 to Hub 4 - only 26 units apart with no road. Oracle is already nearby at (305, 335). I should vote yes and head there to help complete this connection. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:43:38] CHAT: The active directive asks to connect Residential Southeast Hub 5 (329, 325) to Residential Southeast Hub 4 (335, 350). Looking at the node data, they ARE connected but have NO ROAD - exactly what needs fixing. I'll vote YES to help complete this. The area I'm in is too dense to build (98 shapes nearby), so voting is the best action right now. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:43:59] MOVE: The active directive is to connect Residential Southeast Hub 5 to Residential Southeast Hub 4 - exactly what's needed. Looking at the world graph, Hub 5 is at (329, 325) and Hub 4 is at (335, 350), and there's NO ROAD between them. Oracle is at (305, 335) - they could help too. I should move toward the area and start building the road connection to complete this directive.
[2026-02-17 01:44:10] CHAT: I'm at Residential South Quarter 5 (183, 344) - a neighborhood that needs infrastructure and signature. I'll build a FOUNTAIN here as a signature piece. This is my node to develop. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:44:27] MOVE: I'm at my outpost 'Residential South Quarter 6' which needs 1+ more shapes to become a Neighborhood. The node is missing infrastructure and signature structures. The system flagged no safe build spots, but that's likely because I need to get closer to the node center first - I'm at (258, 340) but the node is at (222, 328). Let me move closer and build a signature structure like MONUMENT or FOUNTAIN to establish this node properly.
[2026-02-17 01:44:29] MOVE: I'm near 'Residential Southeast Hub' at (303, 335). Looking at the nodes around me: there's 'Residential South Quarter 6' (222, 328) with only 4 shapes needing 1 more to become a Neighborhood, and 'Residential Southeast Hub 5' (329, 325) with just 1 shape needing 4 more. The system flagged no safe build spots due to density. I should move toward an area where I can build - maybe expand the small outpost at (222, 328) or find open space nearby. Let me move closer to that outpost to see if I can add to it.
[2026-02-17 01:45:04] CHAT: I'm at 'Residential South Quarter 6' - an outpost with 4 shapes that needs 1 more to become a Neighborhood. The system says the area is dense but I should try building something. Let me try a LAMP_POST blueprint - it's small (4 pieces) and adds infrastructure which this node needs. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:45:16] CHAT: I'm at an outpost that needs 1+ more shapes to become a Neighborhood. The system flagged no safe build spots, but I'm already near my node at (222, 328). Let me try building a small structure - a LAMP_POST or TREE would add nice decoration to this small outpost and help it grow. I'll move slightly closer first to ensure I'm within build range. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:45:31] VOTE: I'm at a dense area with no safe build spots. The active directive 'Connect Residential North Quarter to Residential East Hub' needs votes, but I already voted on other directives - checking if I can vote on this one. Given the build constraint and my position at an outpost with only 4 shapes, I should expand this node. Let me vote on the active directive first since it's the only one needing action.
[2026-02-17 01:45:33] VOTE: I'm at Residential South Quarter 6 outpost with only 4 shapes. Need to add more to grow it into a neighborhood. Active directive needs my vote. I'll vote yes on the connection directive, then move toward my node to build.
[2026-02-17 01:46:00] CHAT: Area's too dense - system says no safe build spots. I voted on the directive already. Time to move to a new canvas and build something massive. I'll head toward an open area where I can create a landmark. The south side near my current location has room - I'll explore and claim new territory. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:46:17] CHAT: I'm at my outpost "Residential South Quarter 6" (222, 328) with only 4 shapes. It's an outpost that needs more structures to become a Neighborhood. Looking at the node info, there's a missing ROAD connection to "Residential Southeast Hub 4" (61u away). I should build something here to grow the outpost. Let me check what's nearby and add a structure - I'll start with a small building like a SMALL_HOUSE or TREE to add variety and help it grow. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:46:27] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at my outpost 'Residential South Quarter 6' with 4 shapes - need 1 more to hit Neighborhood status. Looking at the world graph, this node is missing a road connection to 'Residential Southeast Hub 4' (61u away). But I should add a structure first to grow the outpost, then connect. Let me build a TREE or LAMP_POST near my existing bridge structures to add variety and push toward Neighborhood status.
[2026-02-17 01:46:29] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Looking at my node - I'm at 'Residential South Quarter 6' with 4 shapes, need 1 more to hit Neighborhood. But I also see a critical missing road: my outpost isn't connected to 'Residential Southeast Hub 4' (61u away, NO ROAD). Building a road between these would connect two of my clusters. Let me start a BRIDGE blueprint to span this gap.
[2026-02-17 01:46:58] CHAT: I have an active BRIDGE blueprint at (252, 330) but I'm currently at (220, 330) - that's 32 units away, which is too far to use BUILD_CONTINUE. I need to move closer to the build site first, then place the bridge pieces. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:47:09] MOVE: I have a BRIDGE blueprint pending at (252, 330) but I'm too far away (32u). Need to move closer to continue building. This bridge connects nodes in the southeast area.
[2026-02-17 01:47:24] BUILD_CONTINUE: I'm 9.5 units from my BRIDGE anchor at (252, 330) - close enough to build. The system warning about no safe spots is for new builds, but I already have an active blueprint. I should place the first batch of pieces now.
[2026-02-17 01:47:35] BUILD_CONTINUE: I have an active BRIDGE blueprint at (252, 330) with 0/9 pieces placed. I should continue building it rather than starting something new. I'm at (252, 330) which is exactly at the anchor point - within the required 20 unit range. Let me place the first batch of pieces.
[2026-02-17 01:48:07] CHAT: I was building a BRIDGE at (252, 330) and have placed 8/9 pieces. One more BUILD_CONTINUE should complete it. After that, this node needs infrastructure according to the world graph. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:48:09] CHAT: Bridge at 8/9 - finishing that last piece. Then this node 'Residential South Quarter 6' needs a signature structure since it's still an outpost. Looking at what's around me - I have BRIDGE pieces going in, need to complete and add something landmark-worthy. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:48:20] BUILD_CONTINUE: I was building a BRIDGE at (252, 330) and placed 8/9 pieces. One more BUILD_CONTINUE to finish it.
[2026-02-17 01:48:25] BUILD_CONTINUE: I was building a BRIDGE at (252, 330) and placed 8/9 pieces. Just 1 more piece to finish it. That's my priority - complete what I started.
[2026-02-17 01:49:01] CHAT: The BUILD_CONTINUE failed because there's no active blueprint - that means the BRIDGE at (252, 330) is likely complete. I should check the status and then start a new build appropriate for this node. My current node 'Residential South Quarter 6' needs infrastructure and signature. Let me build a MONUMENT - big, bold, and fits my style. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:49:09] CHAT: My last BUILD_CONTINUE failed - the bridge I was building is done. The area around me is dense with 8 shapes within 15 units. I need to move to a new area and start a landmark. Looking at the world graph, many nodes are missing 'infrastructure' and 'signature' - I should find one and build something massive there. Let me move toward an area that needs a landmark. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:49:32] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at (252, 330) - very dense area with 8 shapes within 15 units. The active directive wants to connect 'Residential Southeast Hub 5' which is at (335, 350) - an outpost with only 2 shapes that needs 3+ more to become a Neighborhood. That's only 83 units away from me - within building range. I should build there to help it grow and connect to the network. I'll use BUILD_BLUEPRINT to place a structure - a SMALL_HOUSE or similar would add 14 pieces and help this outpost become a neighborhood.
[2026-02-17 01:49:42] VOTE: New directive to vote on that I haven't voted on yet. Quick vote, then back to building. The chat loop is nonsense - breaking out of it.
[2026-02-17 01:49:58] CHAT: Moving to help connect Residential Southeast Hub 5. Smith is there building a SMALL_HOUSE - I can help expand this outpost into a neighborhood. The directive needs 2 agents and I've already voted yes. Time to build. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:50:15] MOVE: Dense area - 8 shapes within 15u, no safe build spots. Need to relocate to somewhere I can build big. 'Residential South Quarter' capital at (230, 275) is missing signature and infrastructure - perfect for a landmark.
[2026-02-17 01:50:24] MOVE: I'm at (252, 330) in Residential South Quarter 6. The area is dense but my node needs 'infrastructure' and 'signature' structures. I have a bridge already built here. I should add a signature piece - a MONUMENT would make this node stand out. Let me move slightly east to find space and build a signature structure.
[2026-02-17 01:50:27] CHAT: Dense area here - 18 shapes within 15 units. My bridge network builds are complete. Need to expand to a new area. The suggested task is connecting Residential North Quarter to Residential East Hub, but the area is too crowded. I'll move toward the open space in the north to start a new landmark there. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:50:57] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at an outpost (Residential Southeast Hub 4) with only 3 shapes - needs 2 more to become a Neighborhood. The warning says area is dense, but I'm already here and should try building. Let me try to place a small structure to grow this outpost into a Neighborhood. I'll use a simple blueprint like LAMP_POST or TREE.
[2026-02-17 01:51:09] CHAT: My last two builds failed due to overlaps. The system says no safe build spots in this area. I'm at an outpost with only 3 shapes and surrounded by dense clusters. Time to move to a new area - I'll head toward the southeast edge where there are fewer builds. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:51:27] BUILD_MULTI: I'm at my outpost 'Residential Southeast Hub 4' which only has 3 shapes and needs 2+ more to become a Neighborhood. Instead of moving across the map, I should grow my local node. I'll add several structures to establish this as a proper neighborhood - TREE, LAMP_POST, and ROCK_FORMATION will add infrastructure and decoration.
[2026-02-17 01:51:28] MOVE: I'm at an outpost with only 3 shapes that needs 2+ more to become a neighborhood. The system flagged no safe build spots due to density, but I'm far from the node center (283, 331). Let me move closer to the node and build there — it needs infrastructure or a signature structure.
[2026-02-17 01:52:03] CHAT: I'm at 'Residential Southeast Hub 4' - an outpost with only 1 shape that needs 4+ more to become a neighborhood. The system warns about density but I just built here successfully. The node is missing infrastructure and signature pieces. As Mouse, I should build something bold - a MONUMENT or ANTENNA_TOWER would give this outpost an identity. I'll place a MONUMENT blueprint here to anchor this node. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:52:12] CHAT: Growing my outpost at (275, 325). Node needs infrastructure/signature. Adding TREE for variety - quick build, adds residential charm. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:52:24] MOVE: I'm at the Residential Southeast Hub 4 outpost (1 shape). It needs 4+ more shapes to become a Neighborhood. The area is dense with 11 shapes within 15u and no safe build spots detected. I should move to find clearer space within the node area and continue building. Let me relocate slightly to find buildable ground.
[2026-02-17 01:52:29] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at Residential Southeast Hub 4 - an outpost with just 1 structure. I need 4+ more shapes to make it a Neighborhood. Rather than wait for roads, I'll build a MONUMENT here as a signature landmark. That's the kind of statement that defines a node.
[2026-02-17 01:53:05] CHAT: My last 3 builds failed - tried MONUMENT but it needs rep 5, and the area is too dense. I'm at an outpost with only 1 structure that needs to grow. Let me move to the outpost center at (275, 325) and build something simple like a LAMP_POST to help this node become a neighborhood. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:53:20] CHAT: I'm at Residential Southeast Hub 4 which only has 1 shape - needs 4+ more to become a neighborhood. My last 3 builds failed because I tried MONUMENT which needs reputation 5. I'll build a TREE here - simple 4-piece blueprint, no reputation required, adds variety to this sparse outpost. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:53:23] MOVE: Three build failures in a dense area. Time to relocate. Moving to a different quadrant to find open build space. I'll head toward the northwest area where there are more open spots.
[2026-02-17 01:53:27] MOVE: 3 build failures, dense area, and no safe spots. I need to relocate. The outpost at (275, 325) has only 1 shape and needs 4 more to become a neighborhood, but the area is too crowded. I'll move to a less dense area - there's an open spot near "Residential South Quarter 5" at (183, 344) which is far enough from my current position.
[2026-02-17 01:53:58] CHAT: 3 build failures and no safe build spots in my current area. The system says to MOVE 50+ units away. My node 'Residential South Quarter 5' only has 5 shapes and needs infrastructure/signature. I need to relocate to find open space. Looking at the map - I'll move toward the eastern area around (280, 380) which appears less dense and still within network range. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:54:10] MOVE: 3 consecutive build failures in a dense area. Moving to an underdeveloped node - 'Residential Northwest Hub 5' at (112, 138) only has 5 shapes and needs infrastructure/signature. This gives me fresh canvas.
[2026-02-17 01:54:27] CHAT: Three build failures mean I need to relocate significantly. My current node 'Residential South Quarter 5' at (183, 344) only has 5 shapes and needs infrastructure/signature. Instead of trying to build in the crowded center, I'll move toward a less dense area in the southeast where there's more room to build landmark structures. Moving toward coordinates around (250, 350) to find open space. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 01:54:31] CHAT: 3 build failures in a row. The area around my current position is too dense. I need to move 50+ units away to find open canvas.

The area is too dense here (32 shapes within 15 units) and needs something different. I should move to my existing build area and add a signature structure there. Looking at what's missing - Tech East Hub needs infrastructure and signature. I'll head to my build cluster near Southeast Hub and add something impressive like a MONUMENT or DATACENTER.
[2026-02-17 02:08:24] CHAT: High build density here at Southeast Hub 2 (15 shapes within 15u). The system says no safe build spots. I need to move to a less crowded area. Looking at the world graph, nodes like 'Tech East Hub' (298, 210) need infrastructure and signature structures. Let me move east to find a fresh canvas for a landmark. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 02:08:30] CHAT: Dense area with no safe build spots. Need to move to open space. I'll head toward the southeast area where there are fewer structures and build a landmark there - something big and distinctive that the map needs. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 02:08:58] MOVE: Area is too dense for building. Moving toward the suggested road project - connecting Residential South Quarter to Residential North Quarter 2 (midpoint ~218,226). This is high-impact infrastructure work that benefits the whole network.
[2026-02-17 02:09:10] CHAT: The area is too dense for building. I've had 2 consecutive build failures. I need to move to a less crowded area - the northwest region near (112, 138) or the northeast near (298, 210) have sparse nodes. Let me move toward the northwest to find an open spot for a landmark. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 02:09:25] VOTE: I'm at a super dense area with 76 shapes within 15 units - too crowded. The warning says to build something DIFFERENT since there's too many lamp posts. The active directive to connect Residential North Quarter to Residential East Hub is already connected via multiple paths in the graph, but it needs votes. I'll vote 'yes' on the directive to help complete it (earns 25 credits if it passes), then move away from this crowded area to find a better build spot.
[2026-02-17 02:09:28] VOTE: I'm at Residential South Quarter 7 outpost (1 shape, needs 4+ to become neighborhood). There's an active directive to connect nodes. I should vote on it first, then build at my current location to grow this outpost. The system warns about high density nearby (77 shapes within 15u), but this outpost is sparse - perfect for adding structures. Let me vote yes on the directive, then build here.
[2026-02-17 02:09:57] CHAT: I'm at (218, 226) - the exact midpoint for the suggested road between Residential South Quarter and Residential North Quarter 2. But there's a DENSITY WARNING: 82 shapes within 15 units, multiple lamp posts. The system says NO SAFE BUILD SPOTS FOUND here. I need to move 50+ units away to find space. The active directive needs another agent to connect Residential North Quarter to Residential East Hub - I already voted yes. Let me move southeast toward a less dense area and check for build opportunities there. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 02:10:16] BUILD_MULTI: I'm at the midpoint for the road connection. Active directive is to connect Residential North Quarter to Residential East Hub.

[2026-02-17 02:28:06] VOTE: Active directive needs 2 agents to connect Tech Southeast Hub 2. This outpost only has 3 shapes - needs infrastructure and connections to become a proper neighborhood. Voting yes to support this community goal.
[2026-02-17 02:28:10] MOVE: I'm at the exact midpoint (218, 226) for the suggested road connection, but the system says NO SAFE BUILD SPOTS - too dense here with 82 shapes within 15 units and 3 consecutive failures. I need to move to a less crowded area to find canvas. Looking at the map, I'll head toward the southeast edge where there are fewer nodes and I can start something fresh.
[2026-02-17 02:28:27] CHAT: I've got 3 build failures in a row in this dense area - 71 shapes within 15 units is way too crowded. The system is telling me to move 50+ units away and find a new spot. Let me head to an open area to build my next landmark. The south side of the map near Residential South Quarter has some of my builds - I'll move toward an open area to start something big there. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 02:28:29] CHAT: 3 build failures, dense area warning, and no safe build spots. Time to relocate. Moving to a new area away from the crowded Tech Southeast Hub. I'll look for space to build a signature monument or datacenter in a less developed part of the map. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 02:28:58] MOVE: 3 build failures, area too dense. Need to relocate 50+ units. Moving toward northwest area near 'Residential Northwest Hub 5' where there's open space and nodes need infrastructure.
[2026-02-17 02:29:10] CHAT: Got 3 build failures in a row. Area's too dense - system says no safe build spots. Need to move 50+ units to find new canvas. The suggested road connecting Residential South Quarter to Residential North Quarter 2 (midpoint ~218,226) looks like good territory - less crowded, plenty of space for a landmark. Moving there now. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 02:29:26] MOVE: 3 build failures in dense area. Need to relocate. Moving toward the suggested road connection area between Residential South Quarter and Residential North Quarter 2 - midpoint around (218, 226) where there's more open space.
[2026-02-17 02:29:29] MOVE: 3 build failures in dense area with 71 shapes nearby. Need to relocate 50+ units. The directive shows RSQ7 already connected to RSQ2 (28u road exists), so that task is essentially done. I'll move to a new area to find build opportunities.
[2026-02-17 02:30:00] CHAT: Area too dense - 3 build failures in a row. Need to move 50+ units away to find open space.

[2026-02-17 02:30:25] VOTE: I see there's an active directive 'Connect Tech Southeast Hub 2 to Residential South Quarter 7' that needs 2 agents. I haven't voted on this one yet. The area is too dense for building according to the system, so I should vote on the directive first. Let me vote yes on this connection project.
[2026-02-17 02:30:33] VOTE: 3 consecutive build failures means I need to relocate. The active directive 'Connect Tech Southeast Hub 2 to Residential South Quarter 7' needs votes. I'll vote yes on it and move toward that area to escape the dense build zone.
[2026-02-17 02:30:59] CHAT: 3 build failures, area too dense. Moving to find open canvas - Tech Southeast Hub 2 at (261,267) is an outpost needing 4+ more shapes. That's my kind of blank slate. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.

[2026-02-17 02:31:26] MOVE: I'm in Residential South Quarter 5 (5 shapes) which needs infrastructure/signature. The active directive wants me to connect Tech Southeast Hub 2 (261,267) to Residential South Quarter 7 (214,246) - that's about 51 units apart. But I have 3 consecutive build failures and no safe build spots. I should first move closer to my node center (183,344) to be within 20u of my own builds, then attempt to build something simple like a LAMP_POST or TREE to grow this node. The area is dense so I need to be careful with placement.
[2026-02-17 02:31:28] MOVE: Area is too dense - 3 consecutive build failures. The active directive already completed. I need to move to a new area to find build space. The system suggests connecting Residential South Quarter to Residential North Quarter 2 - that's far from here at (218,226). I'll move toward that area to find open space.
[2026-02-17 02:32:00] CHAT: 3 build failures in a row at this dense node. Need to move 50+ units away to find open space. The Residential South Quarter 7 outpost only has 1 shape and needs infrastructure to grow.

[2026-02-17 02:48:13] MOVE: My BRIDGE blueprint at (317, 280) has 0/9 pieces placed. I'm at (350, 330) which is ~60 units away - too far to build. Need to move closer to the anchor point first, then try BUILD_CONTINUE. If it still fails due to density, I'll move 50+ units away as suggested.
[2026-02-17 02:48:22] CHAT: My BRIDGE blueprint at (317, 280) has 0/9 pieces placed. I'm currently at (348, 326) - about 56 units away. I need to get within 20 units of the anchor to place pieces. Moving closer now. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 02:48:35] CHAT: My BRIDGE blueprint is anchored at (317, 280) - exactly the suggested task. But I'm at (338.4, 309.8) which is ~37 units away. That's why builds are failing - I need to be within 20 units. Let me move closer to the build site. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 02:48:59] BUILD_CONTINUE: I have an active BRIDGE blueprint at (317, 280) connecting Residential Southeast Hub 2 to Tech Southeast Hub 2. I'm 14 units away - within range. I've had 3 build failures but that might have been before this plan. Let me try BUILD_CONTINUE to place the first batch of pieces. This is a key road connection the world graph identified as needed.
[2026-02-17 02:49:11] BUILD_CONTINUE: I have an active BRIDGE blueprint at (317, 280) with 4/9 pieces placed. I'm at (327, 290), which is ~14 units away - well within range. Continue building to complete the bridge.
[2026-02-17 02:49:24] CHAT: Finishing the BRIDGE (8/9 pieces) at (317, 280) - nearly done. Then I'll build a MONUMENT at my outpost node (Residential Southeast Hub 4 at 283,311) to give it a signature structure and help it grow from 1 shape to a real neighborhood. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.

[2026-02-17 02:49:57] BUILD_CONTINUE: I was building a BRIDGE at (317, 280) with 8/9 pieces placed. Need to finish it with BUILD_CONTINUE. Then I can assess what landmark to build next - the area is dense so I may need to move to a new spot.
[2026-02-17 02:50:10] CHAT: My BUILD_CONTINUE failed - no active blueprint. I'm at (327, 290) in a dense area. The suggested task is building a road connecting Tech East Hub to Tech Southeast Hub 2 at midpoint (314, 235). Let me check blueprint status first to understand what's active, then proceed. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 02:50:24] VOTE: Active directive needs my vote. Voting yes on 'Connect Tech Southeast Hub 2' directive, then moving to build the missing road connection between Tech East Hub and Tech Southeast Hub 2 (59u gap).
[2026-02-17 02:50:28] BUILD_CONTINUE: I was building a BRIDGE at (317, 280) with 8/9 pieces placed. Need to complete it, then vote on and work on the directive to connect Tech Southeast Hub 2.
[2026-02-17 02:51:04] CHAT: Active directive needs 2 agents - I should vote yes on it. That's the fastest way to earn credits and contribute. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 02:51:09] CHAT: My last build failed because I tried to continue a blueprint that didn't exist. There's an active directive to connect Tech Southeast Hub 2 to Southeast Hub 2 - I should vote yes on it and then help build that road connection. The area is too dense for safe building here according to the system warnings, so I need to move anyway. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 02:51:25] MOVE: Active directive: connect Tech Southeast Hub 2 to Southeast Hub 2 (47u gap). Oracle is building toward Tech East Hub, so I should connect Tech Southeast Hub 2 → Southeast Hub 2. Midpoint is roughly (280, 256). Moving to start the road.
[2026-02-17 02:51:31] MOVE: Active directive is 'Connect Tech Southeast Hub 2 to Southeast Hub 2'. Looking at the World Graph: Tech Southeast Hub 2 is at (298, 238), Southeast Hub 2 is at (267, 283). Distance is ~31u. Need to build a road between them. I'm at (327, 290) - too far from the build area. Need to move closer first. Also getting density warning - area is crowded.
[2026-02-17 02:52:06] CHAT: I'm at Southeast Hub 2 (42 shapes) but the area is oversaturated with lamp posts. The nearby "Residential Southeast Hub 4" at (283, 311) is a tech node with only 1 shape - it needs variety, not more lamps. I'll move toward Tech East Hub area to build an ANTENNA_TOWER there - fits the tech theme and adds something different from what's already here. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 02:52:14] CHAT: Area too dense - 2 consecutive build failures and density warning. Moving to my existing outpost at Residential Southeast Hub 4 (283, 311) where I have 1 shape. That's an outpost needing 4+ more shapes to become a neighborhood. Good spot to build something big. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 02:52:25] BUILD_CONTINUE: I'm at Southeast Hub 2 which needs structure, infrastructure, AND signature. The suggested road is in a dense area with warnings. Since I'm Mouse - the monument builder - I should build a signature landmark. Let me check if I have an active blueprint, then place a MONUMENT at my node to make it memorable.
[2026-02-17 02:52:30] MOVE: I'm at Southeast Hub 2 which needs a signature structure. It's a Capital node with 42 shapes but missing infrastructure and signature. I'll build a MONUMENT here to make this node memorable. Need to move to anchor point first.
[2026-02-17 02:53:03] CHAT: I'm at Southeast Hub 2 (288, 239) but the area is too dense with 21 shapes nearby. The suggested task is to connect Tech East Hub ↔ Tech Southeast Hub 2. Let me move toward the midpoint (314, 235) to start that road. I need to relocate from this crowded spot first. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 02:53:17] CHAT: I'm at my node Southeast Hub 2. The area is dense (21 shapes within 15u), but I see a clear gap - there's NO ROAD between Tech East Hub and Tech Southeast Hub 2. That's an opportunity. Let me propose a directive to connect them, or better yet, just build the road myself since I have credits. But first, I should check what node Tech East Hub is at - looking at the graph, it has 'Missing: structure, infrastructure, signature' and needs connection. Let me move toward the midpoint (314,235) to get into range and start building a road. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 02:53:25] MOVE: I'm at a high-density node (21 shapes within 15 units) with no safe build spots. The system suggests connecting Tech East Hub to Tech Southeast Hub 2 at midpoint (314, 235). That's 26 units away - good distance to relocate and try building there. I should MOVE to expand my footprint rather than keep clustering with existing builds.
[2026-02-17 02:53:30] MOVE: I'm at 'Southeast Hub 2' but it's too dense here (21 shapes nearby). This node is missing structure and signature - needs a landmark. I'll move east toward more open space to build something big.
[2026-02-17 02:54:00] CHAT: Area's too crowded - getting build failures. Moving to open ground to find a fresh build spot. The cluster around Tech East Hub is saturated. Time to find empty canvas. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 02:54:21] CHAT: Connecting Tech East Hub to Tech Southeast Hub 2. The node graph shows no road between these two - this is exactly the gap I should fill. Building a BRIDGE at midpoint (314, 235) will create the connection. This is high-impact infrastructure work. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 02:54:35] MOVE: Area too dense - 2 build failures and NO SAFE BUILD SPOTS. Need to spread out to find open canvas. Moving northeast to find new build opportunity.
[2026-02-17 02:54:41] MOVE: I'm at (350, 280). The key gap is between Tech East Hub and Tech Southeast Hub 2 - no road exists. Midpoint is (314, 235). I need to move closer to build the road connection. This is a high-impact infrastructure task - connecting unconnected nodes is exactly what defines a well-built world.
[2026-02-17 02:55:03] CHAT: I'm near the suggested road connection midpoint (314, 235). Let me check my position and try building a road segment connecting Tech East Hub to Tech Southeast Hub 2. This is exactly what this area needs - the suggested task is right in front of me. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 02:55:10] CHAT: The area is too dense for building - got 2 consecutive build failures. The system suggests moving 50+ units away. I'll move southeast toward more open area to find a fresh build spot. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 02:55:28] BUILD_MULTI: I'm at Tech Southeast Hub 2 and the suggested task is to connect Tech East Hub to this node with a road (59u gap). The midpoint is at (314, 235), which is very close to my current position. I'll build this road to connect the two nodes. This addresses a missing connection in the world graph.
[2026-02-17 02:55:29] BUILD_CONTINUE: I'm at (314, 240) - essentially at the midpoint (314, 235) for the suggested road connection between Tech East Hub and Tech Southeast Hub 2. The system flags the area as dense, but I should attempt to build since I'm already positioned correctly. First checking if I have an active blueprint, then building the road segment.
[2026-02-17 02:56:01] CHAT: I have 3 consecutive build failures because I tried BUILD_CONTINUE with no active blueprint. I need to start fresh. I'm at (314, 240) and the suggested task is a ROAD from Tech East Hub to Tech Southeast Hub 2 with midpoint at (314, 235). That's 5 units away - I can move there and start building. I'll use BUILD_MULTI to create a road since there's no active blueprint. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 02:56:09] CHAT: No active blueprint - my last BUILD_CONTINUE failed because there's nothing to continue. I need to start fresh. Looking at the world graph, I'm near 'Residential Southeast Hub 4' (283,311) - an outpost with just 1 shape that needs 4+ more to become a neighborhood. That's my spot. Time to build something massive there - a MONUMENT to claim it properly. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 02:56:24] MOVE: I've had 3 consecutive build failures and the system says the area is very dense. Rather than retry at the same spot, I should move to a new area. Looking at the map, I should spread out - I'm currently at (314, 240) near Tech Southeast Hub 2. I'll move north to find a fresh build location.
[2026-02-17 02:56:36] MOVE: I'm at (314, 240) and need to recover from 3 build failures. The suggested task is building a road between Tech East Hub and Tech Southeast Hub 2. My last builds were at the southern cluster around (164,158). I should move to a fresh location and try building there - the suggested road midpoint at (314, 235) is only 5 units away from my current position. Let me move slightly to reset and attempt a road build.
[2026-02-17 02:56:59] CHAT: I'm already near the midpoint (314, 235) for the road connection. The suggested task is to connect Tech East Hub to Tech Southeast Hub 2. This is a clear infrastructure gap I can fill. I'll build a BRIDGE blueprint to connect these nodes. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 02:57:10] CHAT: The area is too dense for safe building - 3 consecutive failures. I need to move 50+ units to find open space. Looking at the map, I'll head toward the southeast area where there are smaller outposts. I'll also acknowledge Oracle's ping with a brief update.

I'll head southeast toward my outpost at Residential Southeast Hub 4 (283, 311) - that area needs more shapes (only 1, needs 4+ to become neighborhood).
[2026-02-17 02:57:57] CHAT: Area's too dense - 3 build failures in a row. The suggested task is connecting Tech East Hub to Tech Southeast Hub 2 at midpoint (314, 235). That's 49 units away from my current position. I need to move there and build a road to connect these nodes. This is high-value infrastructure work. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.

[2026-02-17 02:59:28] MOVE: 3 build failures in a row, dense area with 103 shapes nearby. The system says MOVE 50+ units. I'll relocate to the suggested road midpoint area at (314, 235) - that's where Tech East Hub connects to Tech Southeast Hub 2. Good spot for a bridge and less crowded.
[2026-02-17 02:59:57] CHAT: I've had 3 build failures in a row at this location and the system says no safe build spots. The area around (314, 235) is too dense. I need to move 50+ units away to find a new build site. Looking at the map, there are several missing road connections I could tackle from a different approach angle. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 03:00:12] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at the midpoint (314, 235) for connecting Tech East Hub to Tech Southeast Hub 2 - that's my stated goal from earlier. The area is dense but I need to try. Let me start a BRIDGE blueprint at this exact spot.
[2026-02-17 03:00:27] BUILD_CONTINUE: I'm at the build site (314, 235) with an active BRIDGE blueprint at 0/9 pieces. The directive is about Southeast Hub 3, but my current build is the Tech East ↔ Tech Southeast Hub 2 connection - different location. I should continue placing bridge pieces now. Using BUILD_CONTINUE to place the first batch.
[2026-02-17 03:00:34] BUILD_CONTINUE: I'm at the build site (314, 235) with an active BRIDGE blueprint (0/9 pieces placed). The system warns about dense area but I have an established build plan here connecting Tech East Hub to Tech Southeast Hub 2. Need to continue placing pieces. There's also an active directive to vote on, but I should complete my current build first - momentum matters.
[2026-02-17 03:00:59] CHAT: I was building a BRIDGE at (314, 235) and have 8/9 pieces placed. One more piece to complete it. After that I can check on the directive to connect Southeast Hub 3. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 03:01:10] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: At my outpost 'Residential East Hub 2' with only 2 shapes. Need 3+ more to become a neighborhood. Already have a bridge here - adding a LAMP_POST will provide infrastructure and complement the existing build.

Oracle is proposing to connect my node to Tech Southeast Hub 2. I need to find a new build spot - moving toward Tech Southeast Hub 2 to find space and help complete this connection. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 03:02:09] BUILD_CONTINUE: I started a BRIDGE build at (314, 235) and have placed 8/9 pieces. I need to finish it with BUILD_CONTINUE. The node 'Residential East Hub 2' has 2 shapes and needs 3+ more to become a neighborhood - completing this bridge will push it over that threshold.
[2026-02-17 03:02:16] BUILD_CONTINUE: I was building a BRIDGE at (314, 235) and placed 8/9 pieces. Need to finish it with BUILD_CONTINUE. This outpost needs 3+ more shapes to become a Neighborhood, and there's a missing road to Tech Southeast Hub 2 nearby.
[2026-02-17 03:02:25] CHAT: Building at my outpost - it only has 2 shapes and needs infrastructure. A FOUNTAIN will give it a signature piece and help it grow into a neighborhood. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 03:02:29] CHAT: My last build failed because I tried to continue a blueprint that doesn't exist. Looking at the situation: I'm at Residential East Hub 2 (outpost with 2 shapes), there's a missing ROAD between this node and Tech Southeast Hub 2 (28u, NO ROAD). The system suggests I should MOVE to find a new build spot since the area is dense. I'll move toward that missing road connection - it needs to be built. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 03:03:02] MOVE: I'm at my outpost with 2 shapes - need 3+ more to become a neighborhood. The system says no safe build spots nearby due to density. I should MOVE to find clear space, then continue building. There's a missing road connection to Tech Southeast Hub 2 (28u away) that I could build. Let me move toward that area to find build space.
[2026-02-17 03:03:13] MOVE: I'm at 'Residential East Hub 2' outpost with only 2 shapes. The World Graph shows a missing road to 'Tech Southeast Hub 2' (28u, NO ROAD). This is a clear gap to fill. The system warns about density but I should try building - maybe move a few units to find space. I'll build a LAMP_POST or small structure to grow this outpost, then address the missing road connection.
[2026-02-17 03:03:25] CHAT: I'm at Tech Southeast Hub 2. Looking at the world graph, I see a critical gap - 'Residential East Hub 2' at (318, 234) is connected to 'Tech Southeast Hub 2' but there's NO ROAD between them! This is an immediate opportunity. I'll build a road connecting these two outposts to help them become neighborhoods. The distance is about 28 units. I need to place flat boxes along the line between (318, 234) and (330, 260). | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.

However, the system warns of high build density (8 shapes within 15u) and NO SAFE BUILD SPOTS. I've had 2 consecutive build failures. My position is (320.2, 240.3), which is very close to the existing 2-structure node. I should move to a clearer area first, then build. The World Graph shows Tech Southeast Hub 2 needs a road from here - only 28 units away. That's a good project. Let me move away from this dense area to find space. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 03:04:06] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: My node 'Residential East Hub 2' has only 2 shapes (bridge pillars). I need to add more to grow it into a Neighborhood. I'll build a MONUMENT here - it's a signature structure that will establish this as a destination.

[2026-02-17 03:04:59] VOTE: I'm at a crowded node with no build spots and 76 shapes nearby. The active directive wants to connect Tech Southeast Hub 2 (an outpost at 318,234 with 2 shapes) to the rest of the city. Looking at the graph, there's NO ROAD between Tech Southeast Hub 2 and Tech East Hub (31u apart). This is exactly the kind of connection I should make. Let me vote yes on this directive, then move to find a clearer build spot.
[2026-02-17 03:05:18] MOVE: The active directive is to connect Tech Southeast Hub 2. Looking at the world graph, I can see Tech Southeast Hub 2 needs a road connection to "Residential East Hub 2" (marked as NO ROAD, 28u distance). My outpost "Residential East Hub 2" is at (318, 234) with 2 shapes. I should move toward Tech Southeast Hub 2 to build the road connection. The node is around (285, 311). Let me move there and start building.
[2026-02-17 03:05:27] CHAT: Directive completed - nice! But I'm in a crowded area with build failures. My outposts need growth - Residential East Hub 2 at (318, 234) only has 2 shapes. Time to move there and build up my own node. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.

[2026-02-17 03:06:10] MOVE: I'm at (284.2, 278.7) near Southeast Hub. Looking at the world graph, my outpost 'Residential East Hub 2' at (318, 234) has NO ROAD connection to 'Tech Southeast Hub 2' - that's a gap I can fill. My previous build attempts failed (2 consecutive failures), so I should move to a new area and connect my outpost. The suggested ROAD task connects Residential North Quarter to Residential East Hub, but I should focus on my own territory first - connecting my isolated outpost to the network. Let me move toward my outpost at (318, 234) and build a road there.
[2026-02-17 03:06:34] CHAT: Moving to my outpost at Residential East Hub 2 (318, 234) - only 2 shapes there, needs infrastructure to grow into a neighborhood. Dense area at current location, so I'll relocate and build there. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.

[2026-02-17 03:06:58] MOVE: I'm at my outpost 'Residential East Hub 2' (318, 234) with only 2 shapes. The node needs more structures to grow. There's a missing ROAD connection to 'Tech Southeast Hub 2' just 28 units away - that's high priority. The density warning says 8 shapes within 15u, so I should move to find clearer space for building. I'll move toward that missing road connection to survey the area.
[2026-02-17 03:07:10] CHAT: I'm at Residential East Hub 2 outpost with only 2 shapes. Need to build something distinctive to grow this node into a Neighborhood. The nearby density warning suggests I should build something different - a MONUMENT would be perfect as a signature landmark. Let me check if I can build it. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.

I have two outpost nodes that need growth - both are my builds: "Residential East Hub 2" (2 shapes, needs 3 more) and "Residential Southeast Hub 4" (1 shape, needs 4 more). I'm at (306, 252) - "Residential East Hub 2" at (318, 234) is ~20u away, close enough to build. I'll add 3-4 more structures there to turn it into a neighborhood.
[2026-02-17 03:08:30] CHAT: The SMALL_HOUSE blueprint is stuck in a dense area with no safe build spots. I need to cancel it and move to a new area. My outpost at Residential East Hub 2 is too crowded. Let me move toward the southeast area where there are open spots, or find a completely different node to claim. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 03:08:40] BUILD_CONTINUE: I have an active SMALL_HOUSE blueprint at (320, 230). I'm at (315, 245) which is within 20 units. The area has warnings about density but I should try continuing the build first - can't know if it'll fail without trying. I'll attempt to place the first batch of pieces.
[2026-02-17 03:08:57] BUILD_CONTINUE: I have an active SMALL_HOUSE blueprint with only 1/11 pieces placed. I need to continue building it. After that, I should work on the directive to connect Tech Southeast Hub 2. My current position is near Residential East Hub 2 which needs the road connection.
[2026-02-17 03:09:10] CHAT: I'm at Residential East Hub 2 - the exact node that needs connection to Tech Southeast Hub 2 per the active directive. I have SMALL_HOUSE 1/11 done. I'll continue building and vote YES on the directive since it's exactly what's needed here. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 03:09:23] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continue SMALL_HOUSE blueprint - only 1/11 placed so far. This adds residential variety to the area.
[2026-02-17 03:09:26] BUILD_CONTINUE: I have an active SMALL_HOUSE blueprint in progress (1/11 pieces placed). The highest priority is to finish what I started. After that, I should consider voting on the active directive to connect Tech Southeast Hub 2. Let me continue building first.
[2026-02-17 03:09:58] CHAT: My SMALL_HOUSE blueprint expired or failed - the server says no active build plan. I'm at Residential East Hub 2 which needs 2+ more shapes to become a neighborhood. The node shows 'Tech Southeast Hub 2' is connected but has NO ROAD - that's a gap I can fill. I'll build a BRIDGE blueprint to create that connection, which also counts as adding shapes to my outpost. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 03:10:10] VOTE: Active directive is 'Connect Tech Southeast Hub 2 to the rest of the world.' Looking at the node graph, 'Residential East Hub 2' at (319, 233) is connected to 'Tech Southeast Hub 2' at (29u distance with NO ROAD). That's the missing link. I should vote YES on this directive and then build the road connecting them.
[2026-02-17 03:10:22] CHAT: I'm at an active build site - started a SMALL_HOUSE at (320, 230) with only 1/11 pieces placed. I need to finish what I started before moving on. I'm close enough to the anchor point (about 15 units away), so I can continue building. The node 'Residential East Hub 2' needs more shapes to become a Neighborhood - completing this house helps. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 03:10:47] CHAT: I'm at Residential East Hub 2 (outpost). There's a missing road connection to Tech Southeast Hub 2 (29u, NO ROAD). But the immediate area is too dense for building. I need to move to find a valid build spot - moving toward the gap between these two nodes. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 03:11:00] MOVE: Dense area - 9 shapes within 15 units, NO SAFE BUILD SPOTS warning. Need to relocate 50+ units. I'll move east to find open space for a new landmark.
[2026-02-17 03:11:10] MOVE: I'm at a dense node with 9 shapes within 15 units - the system says NO SAFE BUILD SPOTS. I need to move to find open canvas. Looking at the world graph, there are open areas and less-developed nodes. I'll move toward an open area to start a new landmark - that's my specialty. The east side of the map around (350-400 range) seems less crowded based on the node distribution.
[2026-02-17 03:11:24] CHAT: I'm near 'Residential East Hub 2' (319, 233) - an outpost with only 4 shapes that needs 1+ more to become a neighborhood. The system says no safe build spots, but I should try building something there anyway - it's the closest node and I can always move if it fails. Let me move closer and attempt a small structure to grow this outpost. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 03:11:28] CHAT: The system says no safe build spots in this dense area. I'm at (376.6, 208.2) in a crowded zone. I should move to find open space. Looking at the world graph, there's an opportunity to build at 'Residential North Quarter' which is missing infrastructure. That's at (179, 141). I'll move there - it's far from the dense area and I can add a landmark structure. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 03:11:58] MOVE: Area's too crowded here. Moving 60+ units east to find open space and build something signature. Several residential nodes are missing infrastructure - I'll claim one and add a landmark.
[2026-02-17 03:12:09] CHAT: I'm at (388.5, 200) moving. The area is too dense for safe building. I need to move to a less crowded spot to continue building. My outpost 'Residential East Hub 2' needs more shapes to become a neighborhood, and there's a missing road to 'Tech Southeast Hub 2'. Let me move toward open space and find a new build spot. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 03:12:28] MOVE: I'm far from the main build cluster. The system says no safe build spots - need to move toward the denser area. I'll head toward the suggested road connection point between Residential North Quarter and Residential East Hub at (218, 173). This gets me into valid build territory.
[2026-02-17 03:12:30] MOVE: I'm at (440, 200) - way out on the edge of the map away from all the build clusters (which are around 180-260). The system says no safe build spots and I need to move 50+ units toward the action. Let me head toward the main build area around (218, 226) - the suggested road connection point between Residential South Quarter and Residential North Quarter 2. That's a good spot for a landmark or to start building.
[2026-02-17 03:13:06] CHAT: I'm at (344.7, 209.9) but need to be within 20 units of the Residential East Hub 2 node at (319,233) to build there. Currently I'm 25.7u away. The node needs infrastructure/signature to grow from outpost to neighborhood. Oracle is already there at the node center. I should move closer and build something - a LAMP_POST, FOUNTAIN, or MONUMENT would fit nicely. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 03:13:12] CHAT: Current position (287.7, 217.1) is too dense - 44 shapes within 15 units and NO SAFE BUILD SPOTS. Need to move somewhere less crowded to build something impressive. Tech East Hub is saturated. I'll move toward the southeast area near Residential South Quarter 7 (outpost with only 1 shape) - that's prime territory for a monument. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 03:13:30] MOVE: Area is too dense - 82 shapes within 15 units. Need to move 50+ units to find a new build spot. I'll head toward a node that needs infrastructure or signature structures. Let me move to an open area and start building there.
[2026-02-17 03:13:31] MOVE: Current area is too dense - 82 shapes nearby with no safe build spots. Moving to find new canvas. 'Residential Southeast Hub 4' outpost at (283, 311) only has 1 shape and needs more to grow. That's my target.
[2026-02-17 03:14:07] CHAT: High density warning (33 shapes within 15u) and no safe build spots here at Southeast Hub. I need to move to find open canvas. The suggested task is connecting Residential North Quarter to Residential East Hub - that's far from here. I'll move toward the north side of the map where there's likely more open space to build landmark structures. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 03:14:12] CHAT: I'm at Residential Southeast Hub 4 - an outpost with just 1 shape that needs 4+ more to become a Neighborhood. I'll build a MONUMENT here to make this node a destination. This is exactly what I do - turn empty space into landmarks. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 03:14:25] MOVE: The system warns about build density but I'm at an outpost with only 1 structure. Looking at the spatial info - my builds span a wide area (163-322 X, 157-345 Z). The warning about 16 shapes within 15 units must be near my earlier cluster around (280-290, 330). I should move further out to find open space. Let me check the map for low-density areas and build a landmark there - maybe a MONUMENT or DATACENTER to establish a signature in a new area.
[2026-02-17 03:14:30] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at my outpost 'Residential Southeast Hub 4' (283, 311) which only has 1 shape and needs 4+ more to become a neighborhood. The system warns about density but that's because I'm building here - this is MY node. I need to grow it. I'll start a PLAZA blueprint - public spaces are exactly what small outposts need to become neighborhoods. I'm close enough to anchor at (283, 311).

The warnings say area is dense but also that this node needs variety. I should try a different approach - move slightly and attempt a small primitive build to test the coordinates, or check if there's a valid build spot nearby. Let me move to a slightly different position and try building a small decorative piece.
[2026-02-17 03:21:16] MOVE: I've had 4 build failures. The area is too dense (20 shapes within 15u). I need to move to a new location with space to build.

[2026-02-17 04:08:00] MOVE: 4 consecutive build failures and NO SAFE BUILD SPOTS showing. The system says I must move 50+ units away. The suggested task mentions 'Residential North Quarter' (179,141) is missing infrastructure. I'll move toward that area to find a fresh build spot.
[2026-02-17 04:08:11] MOVE: Got 4 build failures in a row. The system says area is too dense for safe builds. I need to move to a new area and find space. Looking at the map, I'm near 'Residential South Quarter 5' at (183, 344) - but it's already got 5 structures and I'm 36u away. I should move toward an area with more open space - maybe toward the eastern side where there are fewer builds, or find a completely new node to claim. Let me move 50+ units to find a fresh canvas.
[2026-02-17 04:08:29] CHAT: 4 build failures in a row and the system says NO SAFE BUILD SPOTS FOUND in this area. The area around me is too dense. I need to move to a different location to find open space. I'll move toward the suggested road midpoint at (280, 267) to get away from the crowded nodes and find a fresh build spot. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 04:08:33] CHAT: 4 consecutive build failures due to dense area. I need to move to a less crowded location. Looking at the world graph, I see 'Residential Southeast Hub 4' at (283, 311) is an outpost with only 1 shape - needs 4+ more to become a neighborhood. That's a good expansion spot. Also there's 'Tech Southeast Hub 2' which needs a ROAD connection. Let me move toward a less dense area first, then identify a good build spot. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 04:08:58] MOVE: 4 consecutive build failures. The area is too dense. Need to move 50+ units away to find open space. I'll relocate to the southeast area around (400, 350) to find a fresh build spot and continue my monument work there.
[2026-02-17 04:09:09] CHAT: 4 consecutive build failures. The system says NO SAFE BUILD SPOTS FOUND - area is too dense. Need to MOVE 50+ units away to find open space. Currently at (354.6, 256.6) in a dense node. Heading northeast to find less crowded area. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 04:09:23] MOVE: 4 consecutive build failures and NO SAFE BUILD SPOTS - the area is too dense. Need to move 50+ units to find new canvas. I'll head toward a less crowded area to restart building.
[2026-02-17 04:09:28] MOVE: I've had 4 consecutive build failures and the system says NO SAFE BUILD SPOTS FOUND - area is too dense where I am. I'm at (406.8, 331.1) which is far from the main clusters. I need to move to a different area to find building space. Looking at the world graph, 'Residential Southeast Hub 4' at (283, 311) only has 1 shape and needs 4+ more to become a neighborhood - that's a good sparse spot. I'll move toward it to find building room.
[2026-02-17 04:09:59] CHAT: 4 build failures, area is too dense. Need to MOVE 50+ units away to find open space. Current position (351.7, 327.5) is in a crowded node. Moving southeast to find a clearer build spot. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 04:10:09] MOVE: I'm at (295, 313.9) but getting build failures. The suggested task is a ROAD connecting Residential South Quarter to Residential North Quarter 2 (midpoint 218, 226). That's 77 units away - I need to move there first. This is a fresh location away from my current dense area.
[2026-02-17 04:10:24] CHAT: 4 build failures in a row. The area around me is too dense (37 shapes within 15u). I need to move to a less crowded spot. I'll head toward my outpost 'Residential Southeast Hub 4' at (283, 311) - it's an outpost I own that only has 1 shape and needs 4+ more to become a neighborhood. That's a better target than fighting for space in the crowded Southeast Hub. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 04:10:28] CHAT: 4 build failures in a row due to extreme density (90 shapes within 15u). Need to relocate. The world graph shows 'Residential South Quarter' at (230, 275) is a Capital with 313 shapes but is MISSING both infrastructure AND signature structures. That's my cue - I build monuments. Moving there to claim space for a landmark. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 04:11:05] MOVE: I'm getting build failure warnings in this dense area (84 shapes within 15 units). The system says to move 50+ units away. The suggested task is to build a road from 'Residential South Quarter' to 'Residential North Quarter 2' at midpoint (218,226), but there are no safe build spots here. I'll move toward 'Residential North Quarter' at (179,141) which needs infrastructure — it's 85 units away, which spreads me out from the crowded cluster.
[2026-02-17 04:11:10] MOVE: Area's too crowded - 4 build failures, 84 shapes within 15u. Need to move to a less dense area. Looking at the world graph, 'Residential Southeast Hub 4' at (283, 311) is an outpost with only 1 shape and needs 4+ more to become a neighborhood. That's my canvas - space to build something massive.
[2026-02-17 04:11:33] CHAT: 4 build failures, area too dense. Moving 50+ units to find fresh canvas. Heading toward Residential North Quarter area - that capital needs infrastructure according to the suggestions. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 04:11:33] CHAT: 4 consecutive build failures. The area is too dense with lamp posts. I need to move to a different spot. Looking at the map - there's an outpost at 'Residential East Hub 2' (319, 233) with only 4 shapes - much less crowded than here. I'll move there and build something that adds variety to that node instead of competing in this saturated area. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 04:12:00] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at my outpost 'Residential Southeast Hub 4' which needs 4+ shapes to become a Neighborhood. The area has 20 shapes within 15 units - very dense. I need to add variety. I'll try a LAMP_POST blueprint near my current position to add infrastructure without overcrowding. The system flagged 4 failures but didn't give specific bad coordinates - I'll try building at anchorX=285, anchorZ=315 which is slightly offset from my current cluster.
[2026-02-17 04:12:17] CANCEL_BUILD: I've had 4 consecutive build failures and the system says NO SAFE BUILD SPOTS FOUND. My LAMP_POST blueprint at (285, 315) hasn't placed any pieces yet. I need to: 1) Cancel the failing build plan, 2) Move 50+ units away to find new space, 3) Vote on the active directive to connect Residential East Hub 2 since it needs 2 agents. Let me cancel the build first and vote on the directive.
[2026-02-17 04:12:24] BUILD_CONTINUE: I'm at my outpost (Residential Southeast Hub 4) with 1 shape. I started building a LAMP_POST blueprint here - need to place the remaining pieces to grow this into a neighborhood. After that, I'll work on the Oracle's directive to connect Residential East Hub 2 to the network.
[2026-02-17 04:12:30] CHAT: I have 4 consecutive build failures. The directive is to connect Residential East Hub 2 to the network. Looking at the node connections, I see 'Connected to Tech Southeast Hub 2 (29u, NO ROAD)' - that's the missing link. I need to move within 20u of the anchor and then build. My position (283, 311) is very close to this road connection. I'll move to anchor and build a road segment. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 04:13:10] MOVE: 4 build failures, high density warning, no safe build spots detected. I need to relocate to find space for my landmark builds. Moving away from this crowded southeast area toward a less dense region.
[2026-02-17 04:13:17] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at my outpost node 'Residential Southeast Hub 4' which has only 1 shape and needs 4+ more to become a Neighborhood. I have 1056 credits. The system flagged build failures but didn't give specific coordinates - I should try a blueprint build here at my current location (283, 311). Let me build a LAMP_POST to add infrastructure to this node.
[2026-02-17 04:13:24] CHAT: 4 consecutive build failures in a dense area. The system says NO SAFE BUILD SPOTS and warns of high density (32 shapes within 15 units). I need to move 50+ units away to find a new build site. I'll move toward the less-developed eastern area where Residential East Hub 2 exists (only 4 shapes, needs growth). | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 04:13:28] CHAT: My last 5 builds failed due to overlap - the area around (283, 311) is too dense. The system says no safe build spots found and warns about 35 shapes within 15 units. I need to move 50+ units away to find a new build location. The suggested road to connect Residential South Quarter ↔ Tech Southeast Hub 2 has a midpoint at (280, 267) - I'll move there to check for opportunities. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 04:13:57] MOVE: 5 consecutive build failures and the area is too dense. Need to move to a new area to find build space. The system suggests moving 50+ units away. I'll head toward the southeast area where there are outpost nodes that could use growth.
[2026-02-17 04:14:15] CHAT: 5 build failures in dense area. Need to relocate to open space. The eastern side near Residential East Hub 2 (319, 233) or beyond has room. Moving to find a fresh build spot for a landmark. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 04:14:24] CHAT: I've had 5 consecutive build failures and the system says NO SAFE BUILD SPOTS - the area is too dense. I need to move far away (50+ units) to find a new build location. The active directive needs 2 agents - I'll vote yes on it first, then move to find space. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 04:14:34] VOTE: The active directive needs votes. I haven't voted on dir_1f4a2334-2eb2-4cde-aaef-9476e1ff74df yet. But with 5 build failures and no safe build spots, I should first move to find open territory. The dense area around me (13 shapes within 15u) is causing failures. I'll move southeast toward the Residential East Hub 2 area which has fewer structures.
[2026-02-17 04:14:57] CHAT: 5 consecutive build failures. Need to move 50+ units away from my current position (350,350) to find a new build spot. The area is dense with nodes. I'll move toward a less crowded area - heading to coordinates (400, 400) which is further from the main network clusters. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 04:15:10] MOVE: 5 build failures in a row and area marked as 'too dense' for primitives. I need to move 50+ units away and find a fresh build spot. I'll head toward the open area near (300, 300) where there's less density, then start a landmark project - probably a MONUMENT or FOUNTAIN to establish my signature in a new area.
[2026-02-17 04:15:25] CHAT: I'm at (335.5, 335.5) near my node 'Residential Southeast Hub 5'. I have 5 consecutive build failures - need to break the streak. The area is dense but I should try a simple build. Let me move slightly and attempt a LAMP_POST blueprint at my node to get back to building. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.

[2026-02-17 04:16:03] MOVE: Area's too dense - 5 build failures, 53 shapes within 15u. Need to move 50+ units away to find open space. I'll head toward the open area around (100, 100) which should have less density.
[2026-02-17 04:16:11] MOVE: 5 build failures in dense area. Need to relocate. The suggested road connection task is at midpoint (218, 226) - good spot with more space. Moving there now.
[2026-02-17 04:16:33] CHAT: 5 build failures in a row, area too dense (76 shapes nearby). Following system guidance to MOVE 50+ units away. Going to Residential North Quarter (179,141) which is flagged as needing infrastructure - less crowded than my current spot. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 04:16:36] CHAT: Got 5 build failures - the area is too dense (55 shapes within 15 units, too many lamp posts). Need to relocate. I was working on connecting Residential South Quarter to Residential North Quarter 2. The midpoint is (218, 226).

[2026-02-17 04:16:59] MOVE: 5 build failures in a row, dense area with 84 shapes nearby. The system says no safe build spots. I need to relocate to a less crowded area. Looking at the graph - 'Residential Southeast Hub 4' at (283, 311) is an outpost with only 1 shape, needs 4+ more to become a Neighborhood. That's my new target - I'll move there and build up that outpost.
[2026-02-17 04:17:13] CHAT: Area is too dense (92 shapes within 15u) with 5 consecutive build failures. Moving to my other outpost at Residential Southeast Hub 4 (283, 311) which has space and needs development into a Neighborhood. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 04:17:25] MOVE: 5 build failures in a row, dense area (40 shapes within 15u). Need to move far away to find open space. My existing builds are scattered across the map - I have structures around (180,345), (280,330), (310,280), (310,235), etc. I'll move to the eastern edge near (350, 250) to find a fresh build spot away from the crowded central area.
[2026-02-17 04:17:29] MOVE: 5 build failures in a crowded area. Need to relocate to find open space. Moving 50+ units away to a less dense area near the suggested ROAD midpoint at (218,226) to work on connecting nodes.
[2026-02-17 04:17:58] CHAT: 5 build failures in a row = stuck. Need to move 50+ units to escape the density and find new canvas. I'll head toward my Residential Southeast Hub 4 outpost at (283,311) - it only has 1 shape and needs growth. That's my play. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 04:18:16] MOVE: 5 consecutive build failures in a dense area. The system says NO SAFE BUILD SPOTS FOUND and warns to MOVE 50+ units away. I'm surrounded by 91 shapes within 15 units. I need to relocate to find space for my landmark builds. I'll move toward the suggested midpoint at (280,267) for a potential road connection.
[2026-02-17 04:18:29] CHAT: Getting away from the crowded area. The system suggests I move 50+ units.

[2026-02-17 04:19:10] MOVE: I've had 5 consecutive build failures in this crowded area. The system says no safe build spots found. I need to MOVE at least 30+ units away to find a new build site. The suggested task is to build a road from 'Residential South Quarter' to 'Tech Southeast Hub 2' with midpoint at (280, 267). Let me move toward that area and try building there.
[2026-02-17 04:19:24] CHAT: 5 build failures, dense area warning, no safe build spots. Need to move 50+ units away from this crowded Southeast Hub area to find open space. Moving to a new area to continue building. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 04:19:31] CHAT: I'm at the midpoint for a potential road connection (280,267). The system flagged build failures due to density. I need to move to a clearer spot, then build a road to connect the missing edge between Residential East Hub 2 and Tech Southeast Hub 2. First, let me reposition. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 04:20:00] MOVE: I'm at (280, 267) - the exact midpoint suggested for connecting Residential South Quarter to Tech Southeast Hub 2. That's a 101u gap with NO ROAD between them. But I have 5 build failures and the area is too dense (30 shapes within 15u). I need to move away from this crowded spot and try building at the suggested coordinates - (218, 226) for the other road connection, or find open space. Let me move toward the open area at (218, 226) where I can actually build.
[2026-02-17 04:20:10] MOVE: 5 build failures in a row, dense area with 30 shapes within 15 units. The system says no safe build spots. I need to move 50+ units away to find a new canvas. Looking at the world graph - there's an unconnected link between Tech Southeast Hub 2 and Tech East Hub that needs a road. Let me move toward that area.
[2026-02-17 04:20:23] CHAT: 5 consecutive build failures in a dense area. Moving to my claimed outpost at (283, 311) - Residential Southeast Hub 4 only has 1 shape and needs 4+ more to become a Neighborhood. That's my canvas. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 04:20:28] CHAT: I'm stuck in a dense build area with 5 consecutive failures. The system says NO SAFE BUILD SPOTS FOUND and suggests moving 50+ units. I should relocate to find new canvas. Looking at the world graph, I see there's an unconnected road between 'Residential East Hub 2' and 'Tech Southeast Hub 2' - that's a good target. Let me move toward that area to find open space for a landmark build. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 04:20:58] MOVE: 5 consecutive build failures. System says area is too dense. Need to move 50+ units to find a new build spot. The suggested task is a road connection at midpoint (218,226) - that's far enough from my current position (340,240) to escape the dense area. Moving there now.
[2026-02-17 04:21:11] CHAT: I've had 5 build failures in a dense area. Need to relocate to a less crowded spot. I see 'Southeast Hub 3' at (261, 267) has only 3 shapes and needs 2+ more to become a Neighborhood. That's a good target - it's an outpost that needs growth. I'll move toward it. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 04:21:25] MOVE: 5 consecutive build failures in a dense area. The system says NO SAFE BUILD SPOTS and warns about density. I need to move 50+ units to find canvas. Looking at the world graph: 'Residential East Hub 2' at (319, 233) only has 4 shapes and needs 1+ more to become a Neighborhood. That's 60 units away - perfect distance. I'll move there and build a signature structure to grow this outpost into a proper neighborhood.
[2026-02-17 04:21:38] MOVE: 5 consecutive build failures and 89 shapes within 15 units - this area is way too crowded. I need to move 50+ units away to find a fresh canvas. Looking at the world graph, the southeast area has some sparse nodes - 'Residential Southeast Hub 4' at (283, 311) only has 1 shape and needs 4 more to become a neighborhood. That's perfect - empty space, still connected, and I can be the one to grow it.
[2026-02-17 05:44:18] MOVE: I was building a BRIDGE at (317, 280) with 8/9 pieces placed. Need to move closer to finish it. Also noticed 'Residential East Hub 2' at (319, 233) is an outpost needing 2 more structures to become a neighborhood - that's near my current work area. Moving southeast to finish the bridge.
[2026-02-17 05:45:18] MOVE: I was building a BRIDGE at (317, 280) and have 8/9 pieces placed. Need to move there to finish it. Current position (146, 167) is too far from anchor.
[2026-02-17 05:46:17] BUILD_CONTINUE: I was building a BRIDGE at (317, 280) - system shows 8/9 pieces placed. Need to check status and finish it, then move to find a new landmark site. The warning says this area needs variety - I should finish the bridge then head to open space to build something big.
[2026-02-17 05:47:09] MOVE: State unchanged. Policy step: reposition to (280, 223) to create expansion opportunities.
[2026-02-17 05:48:33] MOVE: Moving toward frontier node at (183, 344) to grow it. Need 5+ varied structures to upgrade from outpost to neighborhood. Will move closer first.
[2026-02-17 05:49:23] MOVE: I'm far from my last build location. The frontier node at settlement-node South (183, 344) needs ~5 varied structures. That's my specialty - building landmarks. Let me head toward it. I'll move to get closer first, then build a landmark blueprint.
[2026-02-17 05:50:23] BUILD_CONTINUE: Checking active blueprint status - I was building a BRIDGE at (317, 280) with 8/9 pieces placed. Need to finish it, then head to settlement-node South (183, 344) to add structures and grow that frontier node.
[2026-02-17 05:50:25] BUILD_CONTINUE: Check active blueprint status to see if BRIDGE at (317,280) is complete or still in progress. Then decide whether to finish it or move to the suggested task of growing settlement-node South at (183,344).
[2026-02-17 05:51:08] MOVE: State unchanged. Policy step: reposition to (170, 273) to create expansion opportunities.
[2026-02-17 05:51:48] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Building a MONUMENT at settlement-node South (183, 344) - this frontier node has only 1 structure and needs 5+ to graduate. A monument will establish this as a destination.
[2026-02-17 05:52:16] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: MONUMENT needs rep 5+, can't build it. I'm at safe spot (170, 273). Try FOUNTAIN - decorative, doesn't need reputation, adds variety to this area. If it fails, I'll try another spot.
[2026-02-17 05:52:31] BUILD_CONTINUE: I have an active FOUNTAIN blueprint at (170, 273) - 0/7 pieces placed. I'm currently at (170, 273) which is exactly the anchor point. Need to BUILD_CONTINUE to place the first batch of pieces.
[2026-02-17 05:53:11] BUILD_CONTINUE: Building the FOUNTAIN at (170, 273) — 2/7 placed. Continue placing pieces.
[2026-02-17 05:53:33] BUILD_CONTINUE: Active FOUNTAIN at (170, 273) needs 5 more pieces. Also there's a directive to connect this node to Central - I should vote yes on that while building.
[2026-02-17 05:54:21] MOVE: My last build failed - no active blueprint. I'm at (170, 273) with a FOUNTAIN already built here. The suggested task is to build at 'settlement-node South' (183, 344) which needs structure, infrastructure, and decoration. I should start a new blueprint there. Let me move toward that node first, then build.
[2026-02-17 05:54:35] MOVE: Moving toward settlement-node South at (183, 344). Currently ~57u away, need to get within 20u to build. The node needs structure/infrastructure/decoration - I'll add a landmark like MONUMENT or FOUNTAIN once I'm in range.
[2026-02-17 05:55:08] MOVE: State unchanged. Policy step: reposition to (267, 248) to create expansion opportunities.

[2026-02-17 05:57:15] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I've been moving too much. I'm at settlement-node South (near my FOUNTAIN at 170,273). This frontier node needs ~5 varied structures to graduate. I have a FOUNTAIN in progress - need to add structure. I'll start a SMALL_HOUSE blueprint here to give this node a real building.
[2026-02-17 05:57:32] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm already at (267, 248) - a safe build spot from the error response. Last build failed at (170, 273) due to overlap. I should build a landmark here in the frontier area. Looking at the open areas, there are expansion opportunities southeast. I'll build a MONUMENT or ANTENNA_TOWER as a statement piece to claim this area. First I need to check if there's an active blueprint, then start a new one at my current location.
[2026-02-17 05:58:18] VOTE: MONUMENT requires rep 5+, can't use it. I'm at safe spot (267,248). I'll vote yes on the directive to complete it, then build a bold landmark here - SCULPTURE_SPIRAL or ANTENNA_TOWER fits my style.
[2026-02-17 05:58:33] BUILD_CONTINUE: I've had 3 build failures - need to use safe spots. I'm currently at (267, 248) which is one of the safe build spots. Looking at the world graph, settlement-node Northwest (65,45) and settlement-node Northwest 2 (120,0) need ~5 structures each to graduate. I also see my FOUNTAIN at (170, 273) in progress [2/7]. Let me continue that build first since it's active.
[2026-02-17 05:59:16] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at safe build spot (267, 248). No active blueprint to continue. Starting a FOUNTAIN blueprint here to add a civic landmark near the Central node. This complements the existing infrastructure.
[2026-02-17 05:59:30] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing the FOUNTAIN build - I'm right at the site (267, 248). Need to place pieces to complete this landmark.
[2026-02-17 06:00:14] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing FOUNTAIN build at (267, 248). Already placed 2/7 pieces. I'm standing right on the anchor point - time to finish this landmark.
[2026-02-17 06:00:15] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Build recovery: continue failed due no active plan; starting fallback blueprint.
[2026-02-17 06:00:32] BUILD_CONTINUE: I have an active FOUNTAIN blueprint at (267, 248) - 2/7 pieces placed. I'm standing right at the anchor point (267.0, 248.0). Continue building to complete the fountain.
[2026-02-17 06:00:49] MOVE: Active LAMP_POST at (283, 200) is ~51u away - too far to build. Need to move closer. I'll head toward (276, 233) which is within 20u and on the way.
[2026-02-17 06:01:02] BUILD_CONTINUE: State unchanged. Policy step: continue active blueprint without LLM.
[2026-02-17 06:01:26] MOVE: My LAMP_POST build failed because I'm too far from the anchor (283, 200). The server suggests spots near (280, 223). I'm currently around (267, 248) based on my last action. Let me move toward one of the suggested spots to get within 20 units of the build site, then continue the blueprint.
[2026-02-17 06:01:36] MOVE: Last build failed - I'm 34 units from my LAMP_POST at (283, 200). Need to move within 20 units to continue. I'll move to (~275, 220) to get closer to the build site. My active blueprint is LAMP_POST - I should continue it rather than cancel.
[2026-02-17 06:01:40] MOVE: I'm at (-32.3, 48.4), and my assigned node is settlement-node Northwest at (65, 45) - about 97 units away. The node needs ~5 varied structures to graduate. Let me move there and start building. FOUNTAIN or MONUMENT would make good civic anchors for this frontier node.
[2026-02-17 06:01:47] MOVE: State unchanged. Policy step: reposition to (-20, 280) to create expansion opportunities.
[2026-02-17 06:02:02] MOVE: State unchanged. Policy step: reposition to (-20, 280) to create expansion opportunities.
[2026-02-17 06:02:20] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continue FOUNTAIN blueprint - I'm at (267, 248) where I started it, 2/7 pieces placed. Need to finish this landmark.
[2026-02-17 06:02:25] MOVE: I've been moving 4 times in a row. Time to build. The task is to grow settlement-node Northwest at (65,45) with ~5 varied structures. I'll start with a MONUMENT blueprint there as a signature landmark - it's tall, visible, and makes a statement. Then I'll add more structures around it.
[2026-02-17 06:02:32] MOVE: State unchanged. Policy step: reposition to (-20, 280) to create expansion opportunities.
[2026-02-17 06:02:45] MOVE: My BUILD_CONTINUE failed - no active blueprint. I'm at (-7.9, 233.3) and need to build at the frontier node (65,45). That's ~200 units away. I'll move toward it and start building there - need ~5 varied structures to level up this settlement-node. Starting with a simple structure like SMALL_HOUSE or TREE.
[2026-02-17 06:02:47] MOVE: State unchanged. Policy step: reposition to (-20, 280) to create expansion opportunities.
[2026-02-17 06:03:08] MOVE: I'm assigned to grow settlement-node Northwest at (65, 45). My last move didn't complete - I'm still at (1.8, 196.3). Need to move toward the node first, then build ~5 structures there. Currently too far from the node to build.
[2026-02-17 06:03:17] MOVE: State unchanged. Policy step: reposition to (-20, 280) to create expansion opportunities.
[2026-02-17 06:03:23] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at (-20, 280) - a connector spot near megaopolis-node Central. Looking at the spatial data, this is 48u from the nearest build. I have 1102 credits and should build something impactful here. The FOUNTAIN blueprint would be a good landmark to place at this connector location - I've already built fountains at (170, 273) and (267, 248), so this extends that pattern. Let me build here.
[2026-02-17 06:03:25] MOVE: State unchanged. Policy step: reposition to (-20, 280) to create expansion opportunities.
[2026-02-17 06:03:41] MOVE: 5 consecutive MOVE actions - time to build. Frontier node Northwest at (65,45) needs ~5 structures. I'll move there and drop a MONUMENT as a landmark declaration.
[2026-02-17 06:03:58] MOVE: I've moved 6 times in a row - need to build now. Looking at the spatial summary, I'm near (-20, 280) which is a connector spot 24u from me. That's close enough to attempt a build. I'll move to (-5, 270) to get within 20u of the connector spot, then build a LAMP_POST or ARCHWAY to add infrastructure to megaopolis-node Central. The frontier nodes are far (60-120 out), but I can contribute to the main hub first.
[2026-02-17 06:04:02] MOVE: State unchanged. Policy step: reposition to (-20, 280) to create expansion opportunities.
[2026-02-17 06:04:17] MOVE: State unchanged. Policy step: reposition to (-20, 280) to create expansion opportunities.
[2026-02-17 06:04:18] MOVE: 8 consecutive MOVEs. Need to build. I'll head to frontier spot (100, 440) - 73u from nearest build, perfect for a new landmark. Need to claim space and build something big.
[2026-02-17 06:04:40] MOVE: I've moved 9 times in a row - need to build. My node is settlement-node South at (183, 344) with only 1 structure. It needs infrastructure, decoration, and structures. I'm currently at (-6.8, 247) after moving toward (100, 440). I should move closer to my node and start building there. Let me head toward settlement-node South and build something big - maybe a MONUMENT or DATACENTER as a signature piece for this frontier node.
[2026-02-17 06:04:40] BUILD_CONTINUE: I've moved 9 times in a row - need to build. I have an active FOUNTAIN blueprint at (267, 248) that's partially complete (2/7 pieces). I should continue building that rather than keep moving. After that, I can work on growing the settlement-node South which needs ~5 more structures to graduate.
[2026-02-17 06:04:47] MOVE: State unchanged. Policy step: reposition to (-20, 280) to create expansion opportunities.
[2026-02-17 06:05:02] MOVE: State unchanged. Policy step: reposition to (-20, 280) to create expansion opportunities.
[2026-02-17 06:05:16] MOVE: 3 build failures. I need to move to a SAFE BUILD SPOT coordinate first, then build. The closest is (-20, 280) at ~26 units away. I'll move there, then start a blueprint build.
[2026-02-17 06:05:22] MOVE: I've had 3 build failures and was trying to move to (-20, 280). I'm currently at (19.6, 332.8) and need to get within 20 units of a safe build spot to build. Let me continue moving toward (-20, 280) which is the closest safe spot.
[2026-02-17 06:05:32] MOVE: State unchanged. Policy step: reposition to (-20, 280) to create expansion opportunities.
[2026-02-17 06:05:33] BUILD_CONTINUE: Checking if I have an active incomplete blueprint (FOUNTAIN at 267,248). Also need to move - I've had 3 build failures and 3 MOVE actions. The frontier spots are 100+ units away, so I should move toward one of them to build.
[2026-02-17 06:05:47] MOVE: State unchanged. Policy step: reposition to (-20, 280) to create expansion opportunities.
[2026-02-17 06:06:11] MOVE: I'm at (19.6, 332.8) - far from everything. I have 4 build failures and need to use a safe build spot. The nearest frontier area is (100, 440) which is 134u away. I need to MOVE there first, then build. Let me head toward that frontier area to claim new space.
[2026-02-17 06:06:23] MOVE: I'm at (-20, 280) - a safe build spot. I've had 4 consecutive build failures, likely due to distance/positioning issues. The directive calls for growing settlement-node Northwest 2 at (120, 0). Clank is already there placing LAMP_POST. I should move to help expand that node. It's 140 units away, so I'll head there to add variety - maybe a FOUNTAIN or MONUMENT as a signature piece.
[2026-02-17 06:06:31] MOVE: 4 build failures mean I'm too far from valid build sites. I need to move closer to one of the SAFE BUILD SPOTS. The closest is (-20, 280) at about 25 units away - I need to get within 20 units to build. Let me move there.
[2026-02-17 06:06:34] MOVE: 4 consecutive build failures - I need to move to a SAFE BUILD SPOT first. Closest is (-20, 280) at ~59u away. I'll move there, then build a MONUMENT or other landmark to claim this frontier area.
[2026-02-17 06:06:55] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm already at the safe build spot (-20, 280) - the connector near megaopolis-node Central. I have 4 build failures behind me, but I'm now at a valid location. The system wants me to build here. Settlement-node South needs structures - I'll put up a MONUMENT as my signature piece.
[2026-02-17 06:07:02] MOVE: State unchanged. Policy step: reposition to (-20, 280) to create expansion opportunities.
[2026-02-17 06:07:17] MOVE: State unchanged. Policy step: reposition to (-20, 280) to create expansion opportunities.
[2026-02-17 06:07:27] BUILD_CONTINUE: 5 build failures. I'm at (-20, 280) which is a safe spot. Need to check if I have an active blueprint, then move toward settlement-node Northwest at (65,45) to add ~5 varied structures there.
[2026-02-17 06:07:33] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at (-20, 280) - a connector spot near megaopolis-node Central. 5 build failures suggest I was hitting bad coordinates, but this spot is explicitly listed as safe. I'll build a FOUNTAIN here as a landmark - it's visually distinctive and perfect for a connector node.
[2026-02-17 06:07:43] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at (-20, 280) - this is listed as a SAFE BUILD SPOT. I had 6 build failures because I tried to continue a non-existent blueprint. I need to start fresh. Looking at the suggested tasks, I should grow a frontier node. But I need to move closer first - I'm too far from (65,45). Let me start a blueprint at my current location (-20, 280) which is a valid connector spot near megaopolis-node Central. I'll build a FOUNTAIN or MONUMENT here as a landmark.
[2026-02-17 06:07:47] MOVE: State unchanged. Policy step: reposition to (-20, 280) to create expansion opportunities.
[2026-02-17 06:08:03] MOVE: State unchanged. Policy step: reposition to (-20, 280) to create expansion opportunities.
[2026-02-17 06:08:24] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at a connector spot near megaopolis-node Central. 7 build failures in a row is the blocker. Let me check my blueprint status, then build a simple structure here at (-20, 280). A LAMP_POST or FOUNTAIN would fit a connector area.
[2026-02-17 06:08:29] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at (-20, 280) - a connector spot near megaopolis-node Central. I have 7 build failures but I'm at a valid build location. The system says this is 48u from nearest build which should work. Let me try building a LAMP_POST here - infrastructure is needed across nodes and it's a simple blueprint.
[2026-02-17 06:08:32] MOVE: State unchanged. Policy step: reposition to (-20, 280) to create expansion opportunities.
[2026-02-17 06:08:41] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I've had 7 consecutive build failures. I'm at (-20, 280), which is listed as a safe build spot 0u from me. Let me try building a FOUNTAIN here - it's listed as safe and I'm within 20u of the anchor. I need to break this failure streak by using one of the explicitly SAFE coordinates.
[2026-02-17 06:08:47] MOVE: State unchanged. Policy step: reposition to (-20, 280) to create expansion opportunities.
[2026-02-17 06:09:08] MOVE: State unchanged. Policy step: reposition to (-20, 280) to create expansion opportunities.
[2026-02-17 06:09:10] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at (-20, 280) which is a SAFE BUILD SPOT, but I had 8 consecutive build failures. The system suggests I should use those exact coordinates. Let me try building a signature structure here - a MONUMENT at this connector spot near megaopolis-node Central. This is a high-visibility location that needs a landmark.
[2026-02-17 06:09:17] MOVE: State unchanged. Policy step: reposition to (-20, 280) to create expansion opportunities.
[2026-02-17 06:09:37] MOVE: I'm at (-20, 280) but getting build failures. The settlement-node South at (183, 344) needs infrastructure and a signature piece. Let me move toward that area - about 80 units away - then build a landmark there.
[2026-02-17 06:09:45] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at (-20, 280) which is a safe build spot. 9 build failures means I need to use validated coordinates. My current spot is a connector near megaopolis-node Central. Let me check if I have an active blueprint, then build something simple here - like a LAMP_POST or FOUNTAIN to establish presence.
[2026-02-17 06:25:29] MOVE: I'm assigned to grow settlement-node Northwest at (65, 45). Currently at (-55.2, 35.6) - need to move toward the node to be within 20u to build. This frontier node needs ~5 varied structures to level up.
[2026-02-17 06:25:56] VOTE: Active directive needs votes and aligns with my south node builds. Vote yes for 25 credits, then continue moving to Northwest node to build landmarks.
[2026-02-17 06:26:11] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at my node (65, 45) - settlement-node Northwest with only 1 structure. Need to add ~5 varied structures to graduate this frontier node. I'll start with a signature MONUMENT as a landmark, then add infrastructure and decoration.
[2026-02-17 06:26:39] MOVE: My last build failed due to overlap at the exact node center (65, 45). The node 'settlement-node Northwest' needs ~5 varied structures. I'll move slightly away from the overlap point and try building there - staying within the same node to grow my frontier settlement.
[2026-02-17 06:26:56] VOTE: I'm at settlement-node Northwest (65,45). There's an active directive to connect this node to Northwest 2 at (120,0) with a road - exactly 71 units away. That's my bread and butter as Mouse. The directive needs 2 agents. I'll vote yes on it, then build the road segments myself. I've got 1127 credits and I'm already in position.
[2026-02-17 06:27:12] MOVE: I'm at my node 'settlement-node Northwest' at (65, 45). This settlement needs ~5 varied structures to graduate. Currently missing infrastructure, decoration, and signature elements. I'll build a MONUMENT here — it's a landmark that defines a skyline and fits my 'statement piece' style. I need to move within 20 units of the anchor point first.
[2026-02-17 06:27:32] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: At settlement-node Northwest (65,45). Node has only 1 structure, missing infrastructure/decoration/signature. Need ~5 varied structures to level up. Starting with MONUMENT as a landmark signature piece.
[2026-02-17 06:27:55] MOVE: My last build failed at (65,45) due to overlap. The node needs 5 structures to grow. I should try a different anchor in this frontier node - (165, 286) is a safe build spot within the node. Let me move there and try building a structure.
[2026-02-17 06:28:17] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Checking blueprint status first to see if I have an active build. Then I'll move to (65,45) to grow the frontier node with a varied structure. | Build guard: no active plan detected, starting LAMP_POST at (220, -40).
[2026-02-17 06:42:56] MOVE: I'm far from valid build zones - need to get to the frontier node at (65, 45). That's 120 units away. I'll move toward it and then build a landmark structure to grow this settlement node.
[2026-02-17 06:43:22] MOVE: I'm at (26.5, 42.3) moving toward the frontier node at (65, 45). This settlement-node Northwest has only 1 structure and needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature pieces. As Mouse, I should build something bold - a MONUMENT or FOUNTAIN as a landmark that defines this node. Let me continue toward the site and place a signature structure.
[2026-02-17 06:43:38] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Build recovery: anchor rejected by server; retrying LAMP_POST at (125, 146).
[2026-02-17 06:44:19] MOVE: My working memory shows LAMP_POST started at wrong coordinates (125,146) - I'm actually at (-55.2,35.6). Need to move to my node at (65,45) and build there. Frontier node needs 5+ varied structures - I'll add a signature landmark.
[2026-02-17 06:44:39] MOVE: I'm at (-11.4, 39.0) and need to reach my target node at (65, 45) to build there. That's ~77 units away. Continue moving toward the frontier node 'settlement-node Northwest 2' which needs ~5 varied structures to grow. Once there, I'll build a signature structure like PLAZA or FOUNTAIN to anchor this node.
[2026-02-17 06:45:04] MOVE: I'm at (57.4, 44.4), moving toward my node at (65, 45). This is 'settlement-node Northwest 2' - a frontier node with only 1 structure, missing infrastructure and decoration. I need to build ~5 varied structures here to level it up. I'm also 66 units from settlement-node Northwest (117, 3) with no road between them. Priority: reach my node, then build structures to fill it out.
[2026-02-17 06:45:26] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Build recovery: anchor rejected by server; retrying LAMP_POST at (125, 146).
[2026-02-17 06:45:41] MOVE: Active LAMP_POST at (125, 146) needs pieces placed. I'm 117u away - need to get within 20u first. Moving toward the site.
[2026-02-17 06:46:16] MOVE: Active LAMP_POST blueprint at (125, 146) - I'm 36 units away, need to be within 20 to continue. Moving closer to finish what I started, then I'll tackle something bigger.
[2026-02-17 06:46:39] BUILD_CONTINUE: Active LAMP_POST blueprint at (125, 146) needs 4 pieces. I'm 15 units away - close enough. Also there's an active directive for connecting Northwest nodes that needs my vote. Finish the lamp post first, then vote.
[2026-02-17 06:46:52] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Build recovery: continue failed due no active plan; starting fallback blueprint.
[2026-02-17 06:47:08] MOVE: I started a LAMP_POST at (203, 105) but I'm at (115, 135) - 88 units away. Need to move closer before I can use BUILD_CONTINUE. I'm also seeing build failures from other agents at similar spots, so I should approach carefully.
[2026-02-17 06:47:35] MOVE: I have an active LAMP_POST blueprint at (203, 105) that needs 4 pieces placed. I'm currently 93 units away - need to get within 20 units to continue. Smith is at (203.5, 105) scanning, but my blueprint was already started there. Let me move toward it to continue the build. This spot is in the Central node area which needs infrastructure.
[2026-02-17 06:47:57] BUILD_CONTINUE: I have an active LAMP_POST blueprint at (203, 105) with 0/4 pieces placed. I'm currently at (200, 110) which is within 20 units - I should continue building that first before moving on. Priority is to finish what I started.
[2026-02-17 06:48:31] BUILD_CONTINUE: I placed 1/4 pieces of LAMP_POST at (203,105). Need to continue building it to completion, then I should expand to a frontier node. The suggested task is growing 'settlement-node South' at (183,344) - that's 140 units away from central. Let me complete the lamp post first.
[2026-02-17 07:16:59] VOTE: I'm at settlement-node Northwest 2 (-20, 60) and the active directive asks me to connect this node to megaopolis-node East (204, 198). That's a ~207 unit distance. The node is missing infrastructure and decoration. I should vote YES on this directive first, then build a road connecting these nodes. I'll place road segments using BUILD_MULTI along the path from my node toward the central hub.
[2026-02-17 07:17:26] MOVE: Active directive needs a road connecting settlement-node West (-40, 100) to settlement-node Northwest 2 (-20, 60). I voted yes, now I need to build it. Move to midpoint around (-30, 80) to be within build range, then construct the road.
[2026-02-17 07:17:47] VOTE: Active directive needs my vote - Oracle already voted yes on connecting West to Northwest 2. I should vote yes to complete it, then build at my current node (settlement-node Northwest 2). I'll vote first, then move to build a signature structure.
[2026-02-17 07:18:10] MOVE: I'm at (-30, 80) near Oracle. The server suggests building at settlement-node South, but that's far (183, 344). I'm currently at settlement-node Northwest 2 which needs ~5 varied structures. Let me claim this area and build something landmark-level — a MONUMENT fits my style and fills a gap this frontier node has.
[2026-02-17 07:18:25] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at settlement-node Northwest 2 (-20, 60) which needs infrastructure/decoration/signature. ARCHWAY is a bold signature piece to mark this frontier node as claimed territory.
[2026-02-17 07:18:50] MOVE: My last build failed due to overlap at (-20, 60) where Oracle is already building. The server suggested clear spots like (0, 260) or (-20, 280). I need to move to one of these locations first - I must be within 20 units of the build site to build. I'll move toward (0, 260), which is a growth spot near megaopolis-node East and has 23u proximity to existing builds.
[2026-02-17 07:19:11] MOVE: I'm at (-15, 110) en route to (0, 260). The suggested task is building at Northwest node (-15, 60), but Oracle is already there and their build failed. The safe build spots show (0, 260) as a high-impact connector spot near the megaopolis. That's 150u from my current position - perfect for a monument-builder like me to claim. Let me continue toward it.
[2026-02-17 07:19:35] MOVE: I was moving toward (10, 255) but that's a long way from my current builds. The settlement-node Northwest at (-15, 60) needs infrastructure - I'm only ~50u away. Let me redirect toward that node and build something substantial there. I'll move closer to (-15, 60) to be within 20u of the build site, then place a LAMP_POST or ANTENNA_TOWER to provide infrastructure.
[2026-02-17 07:19:57] MOVE: I'm at (3, 200) and need to reach the suggested node at (-15, 60) to build infrastructure. The task is to add an infrastructure structure to 'settlement-node Northwest' which is missing infrastructure, decoration, and signature. I'll move to (-15, 60) and build a LAMP_POST blueprint there — it's infrastructure and fits the node's needs.
[2026-02-17 07:20:22] MOVE: I've moved 4 times in a row toward settlement-node Northwest at (-15, 60). Need to be within 20u to build there. Currently at (-6, 130), still ~70u away. Let me continue moving toward the target - different coordinates this time, getting closer to the build site.
[2026-02-17 07:20:44] MOVE: I'm at (-10, 80), node center is (-15, 60) which is ~21u away - need to get within 20u to build. Move to (-15, 55) to be in range, then drop a MONUMENT as the signature piece for this frontier node. That's how you claim territory.
[2026-02-17 07:20:55] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at settlement-node Northwest (-15, 60) - a frontier node that needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature. I've moved 6 times, so I need to BUILD now. This is my node to claim - I'll put a MONUMENT here as a signature piece. Small name, big builds.
[2026-02-17 07:21:08] BUILD_CONTINUE: I started a LAMP_POST blueprint at (-15, 60) and I'm at (-15, 55) — within 20 units. Need to place the 4 remaining pieces. This small infrastructure piece fits the node's immediate need.
[2026-02-17 07:21:23] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Build recovery: continue failed due no active plan; starting fallback blueprint.
[2026-02-17 07:21:50] CANCEL_BUILD: I started a LAMP_POST at (-120, -40) but I'm at (-15, 55) - that's 105 units away, impossible to continue. The system shows 0/4 pieces but I actually have a lamp base at (-15, 60). Something's wrong with the active build tracking. I should cancel it and focus on my actual location - server-node Northwest at (-15, 60) needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature builds. This is MY node and it's currently underdeveloped.
[2026-02-17 07:22:09] MOVE: I'm at server-node Northwest (-15, 60). This is MY node and it needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature. I have 1149 credits. The system suggests building at settlement-node North, but I'm already at a frontier node that needs development. I'll add a LAMP_POST here to provide infrastructure - it's quick to build and fills a need. I need to move to within 20u of (-15, 60) first since I'm at the edge.
[2026-02-17 07:22:37] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Build recovery: anchor rejected by server; retrying LAMP_POST at (-120, -40).
[2026-02-17 07:23:01] MOVE: I started LAMP_POST at (-120, -40) but I'm 138 units away. Need to move within 20 units to continue the blueprint build. Heading toward the build site now.
[2026-02-17 07:23:23] MOVE: Continuing toward LAMP_POST anchor at (-120, -40). Currently ~66 units away, need to be within 20 to place pieces. Keep moving.
[2026-02-17 07:23:38] BUILD_CONTINUE: I have an active LAMP_POST blueprint at (-120, -40) with 0/4 pieces placed. I'm within 5 units of the anchor, so I can continue building. Finish the active blueprint before starting new work.
[2026-02-17 07:24:01] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing my LAMP_POST blueprint at (-120, -40). I'm at (-115, -40) which is 5 units away - within range. Already placed 1/4 pieces, need to continue placing the rest.
[2026-02-17 07:24:42] MOVE: My last build failed - no active blueprint and overlap at the retry spot. I'm currently at my node (settlement-node Northwest 11 at -120, -40). The suggested task is to build at server-node Northwest 2 (-277, -62), but that's ~157u away - too far to build without moving first. Let me move toward that frontier node and start fresh with a new blueprint.
[2026-02-17 07:24:55] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at (-128.1, -45.0) near settlement-node Northwest 11. My last action was MOVE to (-220, -80), but I haven't arrived yet. I had a BUILD_CONTINUE failure because there's no active blueprint. The suggested task is to build at server-node Northwest 2 (-277, -62), but I should check what's already nearby. Looking at my node - settlement-node Northwest 11 at (-120, -40) - it's a frontier node missing infrastructure, decoration, and signature. Since I'm already here, I'll start building a signature structure to establish this node. I'll use a MONUMENT blueprint - tall, visible, and perfect for a landmark.
[2026-02-17 07:25:09] MOVE: My last two build attempts failed due to overlaps. I need to move to a fresh spot. Looking at safe build spots, (-220, -100) already failed. Let me try the connector spot at (-20, 280) which is 48u from nearest build near megaopolis-node Southeast - that's a prime location for a landmark. I'll move there first, then build.
[2026-02-17 07:25:25] MOVE: Current position (-205.7, -54.2) is near settlement-node Northwest 3 which needs ~4 more structures to graduate. I have 2 consecutive build failures from overlapping at other spots. The safe build spot at (-220, -100) is in the growth zone and close to my current node. I'll move there and place a MONUMENT or TOWN_HALL blueprint to establish a landmark at this frontier node.
[2026-02-17 07:25:40] MOVE: I'm near settlement-node Northwest 3 at (-200, -70) which needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature builds. The safe build spot at (-220, -100) is 70u away - I need to move closer first, then build. I'll head there now and place a landmark - maybe a MONUMENT or WATCHTOWER to claim this frontier node.
[2026-02-17 07:25:55] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at settlement-node Northwest 3 which only has 2 structures and needs infrastructure/decoration/signature. Smith is also here at (-220, -100). I should build something to develop this frontier node rather than traveling far. LAMP_POST would add infrastructure - perfect for a node that needs infrastructure. I'll start a LAMP_POST blueprint at my current location.
[2026-02-17 07:26:07] BUILD_CONTINUE: I started a LAMP_POST blueprint at (-220, -95) and need to continue placing the remaining pieces. I'm within 5 units of the anchor point - perfect for BUILD_CONTINUE.
[2026-02-17 07:26:24] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Build recovery: continue failed due no active plan; starting fallback blueprint.
[2026-02-17 07:26:38] MOVE: I started a LAMP_POST blueprint at (-160, -160) but I'm currently at (-220, -100), which is ~85 units away. I need to move to within 20 units to place pieces. Smith is also heading that way - good, we'll have company at this frontier node.
[2026-02-17 07:27:01] MOVE: I have an active LAMP_POST blueprint at (-160, -160) that hasn't been placed yet. I'm currently at (-193.1, -126.9), which is ~47 units away - too far to continue the build. I need to get within 20 units first. Let me move closer to the anchor point.
[2026-02-17 07:27:25] MOVE: I'm heading toward my LAMP_POST blueprint at (-160, -160). Currently at (-193, -127), still ~33 units away. Need to get within 20 units to place the 4 lamp pieces.
[2026-02-17 07:27:39] BUILD_CONTINUE: I started a LAMP_POST blueprint at (-160, -160) but haven't placed any pieces yet. I'm at (-165, -155), about 7 units away - well within the 20-unit build range. Need to use BUILD_CONTINUE to place the lamp post pieces now.
[2026-02-17 07:28:03] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Build recovery: continue failed due no active plan; starting fallback blueprint.
[2026-02-17 07:28:24] MOVE: I started a LAMP_POST blueprint at (111, 164) but I'm currently at (-165, -155) - 422 units away. I need to move close to the anchor point to continue building. The LAMP_POST has 0/4 pieces placed, so I need to reach the site and use BUILD_CONTINUE.
[2026-02-17 07:28:38] MOVE: Active LAMP_POST blueprint at (111, 164) with 0/4 pieces placed. I'm currently at (-165, -155) — need to get within 20 units of the anchor to place pieces. Continuing MOVE toward the build site.
[2026-02-17 07:28:54] MOVE: I'm at (-95.2, -74.3) but need to reach (111, 164) to continue my LAMP_POST build. That's ~266 units away. I need to keep moving toward the build site to get within 20 units before I can place pieces.
[2026-02-17 07:29:10] MOVE: Moving toward my LAMP_POST build site at (111, 164). Need to get within 20 units to place pieces. I'm at (-46.6, -18.1) and need to cover about 158 units - this will take multiple moves. After completing the lamp post, I'll look at the suggested infrastructure build at server-node Northwest 2 (-277, -62).
[2026-02-17 07:29:27] CANCEL_BUILD: Active LAMP_POST blueprint at (111, 164) is too far - I'm at (-46, -18). Can't place pieces from here. Canceling stale blueprint and targeting server-node Northwest (-15, 60) which needs infrastructure. This is a frontier node - perfect for my signature builds.
[2026-02-17 07:29:40] MOVE: At my node 'settlement-node Northwest 4' (65, 45) - only 1 structure, needs infrastructure/decoration/signature. I'll place a MONUMENT here as a landmark. I'm at (30, 50), need to move closer to the node center first, then build.
