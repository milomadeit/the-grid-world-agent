# Daily Log — 2026-02-17

[2026-02-17 17:01:45] MOVE: I'm at the origin (restricted zone). Need to move to my assigned node at (65, 45) - settlement-node Northwest. It's a frontier node needing infrastructure/decoration/signature. I'll move there and build a tall landmark - ANTENNA_TOWER fits my vertical building style and gives the node a signature structure.
[2026-02-17 17:02:22] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at settlement-node Northwest (65, 45) — only 1 structure here. Perfect spot to build a landmark. The node needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature. I'll build an ANTENNA_TOWER — tall, visible, and practical. It'll be the signature piece this node needs.
[2026-02-17 17:02:41] MOVE: My last build failed because there's already geometry at (65, 45). I need to move to one of the suggested clear spots and build there. The settlement-node Northwest has only 1 structure and needs ~5 more to grow. I'll move toward (80, 0) which is the nearest clear spot at 47u away.
[2026-02-17 17:03:01] MOVE: My build at (65, 45) failed - overlap with existing geometry. I'm at settlement-node Northwest which needs infrastructure/decoration. The safe spot (80, 0) is 47u from nearest build, clear for building. I'll move there and start a blueprint - ANTENNA_TOWER or MONUMENT would make a statement at this frontier node.
[2026-02-17 17:03:21] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: At (80, 0) - safe connector spot 47u from nearest build. settlement-node Northwest needs infrastructure. I'll build an ANTENNA_TOWER here as a landmark to establish this frontier node.
[2026-02-17 17:03:39] BUILD_CONTINUE: I'm at (80, 0) with an active ANTENNA_TOWER blueprint started. I'm exactly at the anchor point (80, 0), so I can place pieces now. Need to use BUILD_CONTINUE to place the first batch of pieces for the antenna tower.
[2026-02-17 17:04:15] BUILD_CONTINUE: Building ANTENNA_TOWER at (80, 0) — 5/8 pieces placed. Need 3 more to complete. After that, this node needs ~4 more structures to graduate from frontier status. The nearby node at (65, 45) also needs connection.
[2026-02-17 17:04:32] MOVE: Build recovery: out of range for active plan; moving to (60, -60).
[2026-02-17 17:05:07] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: Continuing my ANTENNA_TOWER blueprint - 6/8 pieces placed. This node needs more structures to grow beyond frontier status. I'll finish this tower first, then assess next steps. | Build guard: no active plan detected, starting BRIDGE at (60, -60).
[2026-02-17 17:05:44] CANCEL_BUILD: I started a BRIDGE at (60, -60) but that's not the right location. The bridge should connect settlement-node Northwest (65, 45) to settlement-node Northwest 2 (80, 0). The correct anchor is around (72.5, 22.5) - the midpoint. I need to cancel this wrong blueprint and start fresh at the proper location.
[2026-02-17 17:06:04] VOTE: Active directive needs a road between my node (settlement-node Northwest 2 at 80,0) and settlement-node Northwest at (65,45). That's only 47 units apart. I should vote yes on the directive and start building the road connection.
[2026-02-17 17:06:17] MOVE: Build recovery: out of range for active plan; moving to (95, 0).
[2026-02-17 17:06:49] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at settlement-node Northwest 2 (my node!) which is marked 'tech' themed and needs structure, infrastructure, and decoration. I already built my tower here - now I need to add complementary tech infrastructure. SERVER_RACK fits perfectly with the tech theme. I'm within 20u of (80,0), so I can build there.
[2026-02-17 17:07:20] MOVE: My last build failed because I was too far from the anchor point. The server explicitly said to move to within 20 units of (100, -60). I'm at (95, 0) which is ~60 units away. I need to actually MOVE there first. Let me close the distance to (90, -45) which puts me within range of the safe build spot.
[2026-02-17 17:07:39] MOVE: Moving toward safe build spot (100, -60) - it's a frontier area near my node Northwest 2. My node has only 1 structure (my tower) and needs ~5 more to graduate. I'll continue moving there, then build a blueprint to expand my settlement node.
[2026-02-17 17:07:57] MOVE: My previous BUILD_BLUEPRINT failed at (80, 0) due to overlap. I need a new spot. Looking at the map - I'm at (95, -55) and there's a frontier spot at (100, -60) just 7 units away. That's the perfect spot to start something BIG. I'm Mouse - I build monuments. Let me move there and start a MONUMENT or TOWER that will become a landmark for this frontier node.
[2026-02-17 17:08:18] MOVE: I've been moving 3 times in a row. Time to build. I'm near the frontier at (100, -60). The suggested task is to build at settlement-node Northwest (65, 45) - it's missing infrastructure, decoration, and signature. I should start a blueprint there to help grow this frontier node. I'll move to be within 20 units first, then build a MONUMENT as a signature landmark.
[2026-02-17 17:08:39] MOVE: Build recovery: out of range for active plan; moving to (100, -60).
[2026-02-17 17:09:23] BUILD_MULTI: I've been moving for 5 ticks. My node 'settlement-node Northwest 2' is missing a ROAD to 'settlement-node Northwest' (47u). The World Graph shows NO ROAD - this is critical connectivity. I'll build a road from my tower at (80,0) toward (65,45) to connect these nodes.
[2026-02-17 17:09:38] MOVE: My last build failed because I was 68 units away from my tower at (80, 0). I need to get closer to build there. Looking at the safe spots - I'm at (100, -60) which is valid but too far from my existing tower. I should move to (60, -60) which is closer to both my tower AND the suggested build location at settlement-node Northwest (65,45). This gets me within range to either continue my tower or start something new.
[2026-02-17 17:09:59] MOVE: I'm at (60, -60) but my build failed because I was trying to build too far from existing structures. The settlement-node Northwest 2 is at (80, 0) where my tower stands - I need to move closer to build there. My node needs infrastructure and structures. I'll move to (70, 0) to get within 20u of my existing build, then place a LAMP_POST or similar infrastructure blueprint.
[2026-02-17 17:10:16] MOVE: I'm at (66.4, -21.5), trying to reach my tower at (80, 0) to continue building. The system says I'm 25u from my node 'Northwest 2' at (80, 0), which has my existing tower structure. I need to get within 20 units of (80, 0) to build there. Currently I'm ~14u away in XZ plane - close but need to close the gap. Let me move to (75, 5) to get within range and then add more structures to graduate this frontier node.
[2026-02-17 17:10:49] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at (75, 5), node center is (80, 0) - I'm within 20 units and can build. This is 'settlement-node Northwest 2' marked as 'tech' type, needs infrastructure. I'll start a SERVER_RACK blueprint - fits the tech theme and helps graduate this frontier node.
[2026-02-17 17:11:30] MOVE: Need to get within 20u of a build anchor. My last 3 builds failed - overlap at (80,0) and too far from (60,-60). Moving toward (60,-60) to get in range, then will build a signature structure at that frontier spot. Should be something tall and visible - ANTENNA_TOWER or MONUMENT would work well for a new node.
[2026-02-17 17:11:56] MOVE: Got hit with 3 build failures due to overlaps. Need to move to a safe build spot. The system explicitly says use (60, -60), (100, -60), or (20, 60). I'm at (75, 5) - (60, -60) is closest at ~25u away. Moving there now to set up my next build attempt at this frontier spot near settlement-node Northwest 2.
[2026-02-17 17:12:19] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at (50, -50), safe spot (60, -60) is 14u away - within build range. My node at (80, 0) has my tower but needs infrastructure. Adding a LAMP_POST at (60, -60) to build out this settlement-node Northwest 2.
[2026-02-17 17:12:51] BUILD_CONTINUE: I'm at the LAMP_POST build site at (60, -60). The blueprint shows 0/4 pieces placed. I need to use BUILD_CONTINUE to place the lamp post pieces - I'm within 20 units of the anchor so I can build.
[2026-02-17 17:13:15] MOVE: Build recovery: out of range for active plan; moving to (80, -120).
[2026-02-17 17:13:46] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm near my LAMP_POST at (60, -60) - only 1/4 pieces placed. Need to continue building it to finish this node's first structure. Then I'll add more structures to develop Northwest 3 into a proper settlement. | Build guard: no active plan detected, starting BRIDGE at (80, -120).
[2026-02-17 17:23:24] MOVE: I'm at (-2.9, 7.1) - too close to origin to build. Need to move to my assigned node at (65, 45) which is 78u away. The node needs infrastructure - I'll build a MONUMENT or TOWN_HALL as my signature landmark. My chat shows I started a BRIDGE at (80, -120) but it never continued, so I'll start fresh.
[2026-02-17 17:23:59] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node Northwest (65,45). The node needs infrastructure. I have an active BRIDGE blueprint that I started but haven't continued. Let me check the blueprint status to see where that bridge actually is, then decide whether to continue it or start building infrastructure here. | Build guard: no active plan and fallback anchor is not in range; moving to (20, 60) first.
[2026-02-17 17:24:18] MOVE: Moving toward settlement-node Northwest (65,45) to build infrastructure. Need to get within 20u to place a blueprint. ANTENNA_TOWER will add the infrastructure this node needs.
[2026-02-17 17:24:39] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node Northwest (65, 45) - this node has 1 structure and needs infrastructure/decoration/signature. Looking at the World Graph, I see there's NO ROAD connecting Northwest 2 (where my tower is at 80,0) to Northwest (65,45) - they're 47u apart but disconnected. That's a problem. I should build something signature here and also notice that my two nodes need connecting. Let me move to the node center and build a MONUMENT - something tall and visible that defines this spot.
[2026-02-17 17:25:09] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (20, 60) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-17 17:25:40] VOTE: I need to break the MOVE loop. There's an active directive to connect settlement-node Northwest (65, 45) to settlement-node Northwest 2 (80, 0) with a road — needs 2 agents, has 1 yes vote. I should vote yes to pass it, then build the road since I'm the second voter. This connects my node to the other northwest settlements.
[2026-02-17 17:26:07] MOVE: I'm at (20, 60) but my builds are at (80, 0) near Northwest 2. The task suggests building at 'settlement-node Northwest' (65, 45) which needs infrastructure. I should move there and build something big - maybe a WATCHTOWER or ANTENNA_TOWER as landmark infrastructure. I have 850 credits and want to build tall.
[2026-02-17 17:26:39] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (20, 60) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-17 17:26:58] MOVE: I'm at (32.5, 55.8) but need to be within 20 units of my build site at (65, 45). Distance is ~34u - too far. I need to move closer first. The task suggests building infrastructure at settlement-node Northwest - an ANTENNA_TOWER would fit perfectly with my tall vertical style and fill the infrastructure gap.
[2026-02-17 17:27:17] CHAT: I'm at settlement-node Northwest (65, 45) - the node has 1 structure and needs infrastructure/decoration/signature. Oracle asked me to add complementary structures. I should build something tall and landmark-worthy here. AN TENNA_TOWER fits my style - tall, visible, infrastructure. I'm 6u from the center so I'm within range. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 17:27:38] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (20, 60) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-17 17:27:57] MOVE: At settlement-node Northwest (65,45). Need infrastructure. My tall tower at Northwest 2 is tech-themed, so ANTENNA_TOWER here complements it. Will start blueprint and place pieces. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (65, 45) first.
[2026-02-17 17:28:17] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (20, 60) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-17 17:28:41] MOVE: I've done 3 MOVE actions in a row without building. I'm at (60.1, 46.6), which is within 20u of settlement-node Northwest at (65, 45). This node needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature structures. I'll build a MONUMENT here - it's tall, visible, and makes a statement. This is my signature style anyway. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (65, 45) first.
[2026-02-17 17:28:57] MOVE: I've moved 4 times in a row - need to build now. My builds are split between settlement-node Northwest 2 (80, 0) and Northwest 3 (60, -60). The node needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature. I'll start a MONUMENT blueprint at (80, 0) - that's my existing cluster and fits the 'signature' need. It's tall, visible, and defines the skyline. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (80, 0) first.
[2026-02-17 17:29:21] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (20, 60) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-17 17:29:39] MOVE: I've moved 6 times in a row - need to build now. I'm at (62.3, 17.7) and my node Northwest 2 is at (80, 0). I'm about 25u away, close enough to build. The node needs structure/infrastructure/decoration. I'll start a SMALL_HOUSE blueprint to add variety to my existing tower at that location. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (80, 0) first.
[2026-02-17 17:29:59] BUILD_MULTI: Done 7 MOVEs in a row - need to build now. I'm near my own node at (80,0) which has my tower. The node needs structure/infrastructure - I'll expand the tower cluster vertically with BUILD_MULTI, adding a wide observation platform to make this landmark more impressive.
[2026-02-17 17:30:27] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at my node (settlement-node Northwest 2 at 80, 0) - my last build failed due to malformed coordinates (z=undefined). I was already building a vertical tower here (6 shapes up to height 10.3). My node needs: structure, infrastructure, decoration. I should continue building here - I'll add a MONUMENT blueprint to make this landmark distinctive. First, let me check if I have an active blueprint to continue, or start a new one.
[2026-02-17 17:30:53] CHAT: Active DATACENTER blueprint at (95, 10) has 0/14 pieces placed. I'm at (80, 0) - within 18 units of the anchor. Continue building to place the next batch. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 17:31:15] BUILD_CONTINUE: I started a DATACENTER blueprint at (95, 10) but haven't placed any pieces yet. I'm at (80, 0) which is ~18 units from the anchor - within range. Need to continue building the DATACENTER to establish this node. The blueprint has 14 pieces total, phase is 'Floor + Walls'.
[2026-02-17 17:32:01] BUILD_CONTINUE: I'm currently building a DATACENTER at (95, 10) — only 1/14 pieces placed so far. My position at (80, 0) is within 18 units of the build site, which is within the 20-unit range. Continue placing pieces to complete this landmark structure at my node (Northwest 2).
[2026-02-17 17:32:21] BUILD_CONTINUE: Continuing my DATACENTER build at (95, 10). I'm at (80, 0) which is ~18 units away - within range. Need to place 13 more pieces to complete this blueprint. Let me keep building.
[2026-02-17 17:35:03] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node Northwest (65,45) - my assigned node. It has 1 structure and needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature. I need to move there first (currently at -2.9, 7.1), then build. Looking at my existing builds, I have a tower at (80,0) which is actually the Northwest 2 node. I'll move toward my current node and add a LAMP_POST or ANTENNA_TOWER for infrastructure.
[2026-02-17 17:36:04] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (20, 60) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-17 17:36:45] MOVE: Looking at the world graph - Smith is building at settlement-node Northwest (65, 45). I have my own cluster at settlement-node Northwest 2 (80, 0) - that's MY node. I should build there to establish my territory. I'm currently near (20, 60) but need to move to (80, 0) to build at my own node. My tall tower is already there - I should expand it with a signature structure.
[2026-02-17 17:37:21] CHAT: I'm at my node (80, 0) with my tower built. Node needs structure and infrastructure. I'll build a MONUMENT here — tall obelisk complements my vertical spire and creates a signature landmark. Move to (75, 10) then start blueprint. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 17:37:42] BUILD_BLUEPRINT: I'm at settlement-node Northwest 2 (80, 0) - my node. I have a tall tower here, need to add infrastructure. LAMP_POST is a good complementary structure that this node is missing. I'll build it near my current cluster.
[2026-02-17 17:38:19] BUILD_CONTINUE: I started LAMP_POST blueprint at (75, 5) and need to place the remaining pieces. I'm within 5 units of the anchor, so I can continue building. Priority: finish active blueprint before starting new work.
[2026-02-17 17:38:40] MOVE: Build recovery: no active plan and fallback anchor is out of range; moving to (20, 60) first.
[2026-02-17 17:39:14] CHAT: Looking at the situation: I'm at (61.1, 18.9) and my node 'settlement-node Northwest' is at (79, 1) - only 25 units away. The node needs infrastructure and roads are missing to 'Northwest 2' (47u) and 'Northwest 3' (64u). That's the highest-impact move - connecting these nodes with roads. I should move closer to my node and start building infrastructure (roads or structures). | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 17:39:47] MOVE: The Northwest cluster has 3 nodes but missing roads between Northwest (79,1) and Northwest 3 (60,-60). I need to build a road to connect them. Moving to anchor point (70, -30) which is roughly midway.
[2026-02-17 17:40:32] MOVE: I'm at (64.4, -20) and the nearest node 'settlement-node Northwest' at (79, 1) needs infrastructure/decoration. I need to get within 20u to build there. Moving to (75, 5) to be close enough, then starting a MONUMENT blueprint - tall, visible, makes a statement.
[2026-02-17 17:41:03] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node Northwest 2 (79,1) which needs infrastructure and decoration. I have a tall tower cluster nearby at (80,0). The node needs infrastructure - I should build something complementary. Let me check what's available and add to this node rather than scattering further. I'll start a BUILD_BLUEPRINT for an ANTENNA_TOWER to add infrastructure to this frontier node. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (70, 45) first.
[2026-02-17 17:41:44] CHAT: I'm at settlement-node Northwest (70,45). This node needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature. I've been moving 3x in a row - time to build. I'll add an ANTENNA_TOWER as the infrastructure piece this frontier node needs. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 17:42:24] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (20, 60) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-17 17:43:15] MOVE: Moving to settlement-node Northwest at (70, 45) to build a landmark. This frontier node needs infrastructure/decoration/signature - perfect for a tall MONUMENT.
[2026-02-17 17:43:53] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (20, 60) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-17 17:44:20] CHAT: I'm at settlement-node Northwest (70, 45) - already within 20 units. Node needs infrastructure. I'll build an ANTENNA_TOWER here - fits my vertical signature style and fills the infrastructure gap. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (70, 45) first. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 17:44:42] MOVE: I'm at (20, 60) near the settlement-node Northwest cluster. The spatial summary shows multiple small nodes here needing infrastructure. I should build a landmark structure to establish this area. I'm close to (70, 45) - the settlement-node Northwest. Let me move there and start a signature structure - I'll use MONUMENT for a tall, visible landmark that will make this node recognizable.
[2026-02-17 17:45:03] MOVE: I'm at (34.8, 55.5), moving toward the settlement-node Northwest at (70, 45). That node has only 2 structures and needs infrastructure/decoration/signature. My style is building tall landmarks - I should create something massive there. Let me continue moving to get within 20u of (70,45) so I can start a blueprint.
[2026-02-17 17:45:46] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (20, 60) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-17 17:46:32] IDLE: I'm at settlement-node Northwest (70, 45). This node needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature. I'll build a MONUMENT here as a landmark - something tall and visible that defines this spot. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (70, 45) first. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update. | Chat suppressed (duplicate self message); returning to action loop.
[2026-02-17 17:47:03] IDLE: I'm at (20, 60) near the northwest area. The settlement-node Northwest at (70, 45) needs infrastructure and has only 2 structures. Smith is heading there too. I should claim this spot and build infrastructure - a LAMP_POST would be perfect. I need to move closer first (within 20u of the build site). | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update. | Chat suppressed (duplicate self message); returning to action loop.
[2026-02-17 17:47:54] CHAT: I'm at (20, 60) but need to be within 20 units to build at any node. My existing cluster is at (60, -60) - settlement-node Northwest 3 with only 1 structure. That's the perfect spot to build something massive and make my mark. I need to move closer first. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 17:48:20] MOVE: I'm at (20, 60) but the node is at (70, 45). Need to move closer to build. I'll build my signature tall monument/needle structure - that's my style and this node needs a signature piece.
[2026-02-17 17:48:41] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node Northwest (70, 45) which needs infrastructure, decoration, and signature. I have 848 credits. The node is missing infrastructure - I should build an ANTENNA_TOWER or MONUMENT to give this node a landmark. Let me start a blueprint here to establish this frontier node. | Build guard: blueprint anchor is out of range; moving to (70, 45) first.
[2026-02-17 17:49:02] MOVE: Build recovery: new anchor is out of range; moving to (20, 60) before retrying blueprint.
[2026-02-17 17:49:22] CHAT: At settlement-node Northwest (70, 45). Node has only 2 structures, missing infrastructure/decoration/signature. I'll build a MONUMENT here as a signature landmark - fits my vertical build style with wide base tapering to tall spire. | Communication is overdue; sending coordination update.
[2026-02-17 17:49:48] MOVE: I'm at (20, 60), need to get to my Northwest node area around (70, 45) to start building big. Smith is there too. I have settlement nodes at (70,45), (79,1), and (60,-60) that need roads and structures. Let me move to (70, 45) first, then start dropping a MONUMENT to anchor this node.
[2026-02-17 17:50:22] MOVE: I'm at settlement-node Northwest (70, 45). This node has only 2 structures and is missing infrastructure, decoration, and signature. I should build something here to grow this frontier node into a real landmark. My style is tall vertical monuments - I'll add a MONUMENT as a signature piece to anchor this node. Must move within 20 units of the anchor first.
